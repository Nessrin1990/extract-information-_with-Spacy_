To \\nachieve acutely-needed \\nchange, ESG needs to \\nevolve to measure real-\\nworld Impact.\\n\\n2\\n\\nCurrent environmental,  social and governance  (ESG) \\nreporting  does not measure the scope of positive  impact \\non the world.  Instead, it focuses  on measuring  the dollar \\nvalue of risk / return.\\n\\nWe need to create a system that measures and scrutinizes \\nactual positive  impact on our planet, so unsuspecting \\nindividual investors  can choose to support companies  that \\ncan make and prioritize  positive  change.\\n\\nIndividual investors – who entrust their money  to ESG \\nfunds of large investment  institutions  – are perhaps \\nunaware that their money  can be used to buy shares of \\ncompanies that make climate change worse,  not better.\\n\\nAn obvious  example  of this is measuring  the impact of the \\nautomotive  industry. One might think that the more electric \\nvehicles  an automaker  sells, as a percentage of total \\nvolumes,  the better its ESG score. However,  this is not the \\ncase. As long as a company continues to slightly  decrease \\nemissions  of its manufacturing operations  while churning \\nout gas-guzzlers,  its ESG ratings are likely  to go up.\\n\\nVehicle use-phase  emissions,  which represent 80-90%  of \\ntotal automotive  emissions  (included in Scope 3 of ESG \\nreporting), tend to be misreported  due to the use of \\nunrealistic assumptions  or not reported  at all.\\n\\nIt’s easy to see why some  oil & gas companies rank higher \\nthan Tesla  on “Environmental  Impact.”\\n\\n“The most striking feature of the [ESG rating] system is \\nhow rarely a company’s record on climate change seems to \\nget in the way of its climb up the ESG ladder—or even to \\nfactor at all.”\\n\\nESG Mirage:  Bloomberg  Businessweek\\n\\nOn the product front, companies should be required to use \\nreal-world  data wherever  remotely  feasible  and make it \\nclear when estimates  are provided  instead of real-world \\nfigures. An example  of this is vehicle “use-phase” \\nemissions,  accounting for the vast majority  of lifecycle \\nemissions.  Automakers'  estimates on lifetime  vehicle \\nmileage  and lifetime  fuel consumption vary  dramatically \\nand almost  never reflect  real-world  data. Automakers  often \\nhave access to this data, but they don’t disclose  it.\\n\\nWhen it comes to a company’s employees,  it is essential \\nthat they’re  treated well,  with a system in place to prevent \\ndiscrimination  of any kind, that they  have a safe \\nworkplace and that they are rewarded appropriately,  with \\nsignificant upside if their employer  does well.\\n\\nMany ESG ratings  evaluate:  “Does  this ESG issue impact the \\nprofitability  of the company?” We need a system that \\nevaluates:  “Does  the growth of this company have a \\npositive  impact on the world?”\\n\\nThis evolution  of ESG needs to be championed by \\ninstitutional  investors,  rating agencies, public companies \\nand the general  public. As the world  needs to strive  for a \\nsubstantial positive  impact, we  won’t be referring  to ESG in \\nthis report.  Instead, we’ll talk about Impact.\\n\\n\\x0cIn 2021, the global fleet of Tesla vehicles, energy storage and solar panels\\n\\nenabled our customers to avoid emitting 8.4 million metric tons of CO2e\\n\\nThe 6.8 million  metric tons of vehicle CO2e savings estimate is based on the net CO2e savings during the use-phase of a Tesla vehicle compared to an ICE vehicle with a real-world fuel economy of \\n~24 mpg (of which 0.9 million  metric tons was avoided through annual renewables matching for the global Supercharger network and home charging in California). The 1.6 million  metric tons of \\nsolar + storage CO2e savings estimate is based on CO2e avoided through generation of zero-emission electricity  from Tesla solar panels, including  energy stored and later dispatched from our \\nenergy storage products. Geographic distribution  of our deliveries (both vehicle and solar), grid mix at the country, state and province level and upstream emissions are reflected in these figures.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cThe Future is Electric\\n\\nLifetime fuel consumption and use-phase GHG emissions\\n\\n30,000 litres (~8,000 U.S. Gallons) of fuel burned per car\\n\\n70 tons of CO2e released into the atmosphere\\n\\nBurned fossil fuel is extremely difficult to decarbonize\\nas carbon capture is not economically viable today\\n\\n70 MWh of electricity charged per car \\n\\n30 tons of CO2 released, assuming current global grid mix\\n\\nProduction and lifetime use of EVs is possible to decarbonize \\nusing well-established technologies\\n\\nBattery pack is recycled at the end-of-life and used\\nto build a brand-new battery pack, over and over again.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cMore Energy Generation \\nThan Consumption\\n\\nTesla solar panels have generated more electricity than has been\\nconsumed by our vehicles and factories between 2012 and 2021 \\n\\nTesla Cumulative Net Energy Impact: 2012-2021 (TWh)\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cForeword 02\\n\\nPeople and Culture 21\\n\\nAvoided Emissions 03\\n\\nThe Future is Electric 04\\n\\nTesla Net Energy Impact 05\\n\\nOur Goals 07\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOur People Plan\\n\\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\\n\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nEmployee Engagement\\n\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nSafety\\n\\nMaking an Impact 08\\n\\nEnvironmental Impact 55\\n\\nProduct Impact 76\\n\\nVehicle Affordability\\n\\nVehicle Usage\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\n\\nSolar + Storage Product\\n\\nSupply Chain 94\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBattery Recycling\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n\\nCorporate Governance 10\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nOur Approach\\n\\nBoard Committees\\n\\nCompensation Philosophy\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nLifecycle Analysis of EVs vs. ICE Vehicles\\n\\nReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\n\\nGHG Emissions\\n\\nNOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants\\n\\nTesla Semi\\n\\nWaste Generated Per Vehicle\\n\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\nWater Used Per Vehicle\\n\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nEmissions Credits\\n\\nSummary 117\\n\\nAppendix 122\\n\\nResponsible Sourcing and Supplier Audit Program\\n\\nCover location: Arevon's Townsite Solar and Storage Facility\\n\\n\\x0cOur Goals\\n\\nTesla’s  purpose  is to accelerate the world’s  transition  to sustainable energy.\\n\\nWe strive to be the best on every  metric relevant  to our mission to accelerate the world’s  transition  to \\nsustainable energy. To  maximize  our impact, we plan to continue increasing our production volumes  and the \\naccessibility of our products. In more concrete terms, this means that by 2030 we are aiming to sell 20 million \\nelectric vehicles  per year (compared to 0.94 million  in 2021)  and deploy  1,500 GWh of energy storage  per year \\n(compared to 4 GWh in 2021).\\n\\nIf we were  to achieve  such a vehicle delivery  milestone  through a consistent growth  rate, the total Tesla vehicle \\nfleet  would surpass tens of millions  of vehicles  by 2030, and each of those  vehicles could save tons of CO2e \\nemissions  every  year of usage.\\n\\nFurthermore,  each product we make  must be continuously  improved  at each step of its lifecycle:  from \\nmanufacturing to consumer  use to recycling.\\n\\nWe must also improve  every  metric, including the energy and water used to make our products, how safe our \\ncustomers  and employees  are and the affordability  and accessibility  of our products. Each of these themes  will \\nbe covered  in this year’s Impact Report.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cMaking an Impact\\nMission and the Tesla Ecosystem\\n\\nSustainability  drives  us. And not just our products — it drives  our values and mission  as a company. It's at the \\ncore of everything  we do and is what motivates  us in our work.  It also matters greatly to our customers, \\nemployees  and shareholders.  Our products and services are focused on transportation,  energy production and \\nstorage  — each of which have traditionally  been some of the biggest polluters  both in the U.S. and globally.\\n\\nTo  achieve a zero-emissions  future, we continue to implement  programs  and initiatives  at our global \\nmanufacturing facilities and in our local communities. \\n\\nGlobal \\nGreenhouse  Gas (GHG) Emissions \\nby Economic Sector\\n\\nU.S. \\nGreenhouse  Gas (GHG) Emissions \\nby Economic Sector\\n\\nOther\\n12%\\n\\nBuilding\\n6%\\n\\nElectricity & \\nHeat \\nProduction*\\n31%\\n\\nAgriculture, Forestry & \\nOther Land Use\\n3%\\n\\nOther\\n9%\\n\\nElectricity & \\nHeat \\nProduction*\\n35%\\n\\nAgriculture, Forestry \\n& Other Land Use\\n15%\\n\\nBuilding\\n11%\\n\\nIndustry\\n12%\\n\\nIndustry\\n19%\\n\\nTransportation*\\n17%\\n\\nTransportation*\\n30%\\n\\n8\\n\\n*Tesla-related sectors.

The world  cannot reduce GHG emissions  without  addressing both \\nenergy generation  and consumption.  And the world  cannot address its energy habits without  first directly \\nreducing emissions  in the transportation  and energy sectors.\\n\\nWe are designing and manufacturing a complete energy and transportation  ecosystem. We both develop  the \\ntechnology  behind this ecosystem and focus on the affordability  of  the products that comprise  it. We seek to \\nachieve  this through our R&D  and software  development  efforts  as well as through our continuous drive to \\ndevelop  advanced manufacturing capabilities. \\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate \\nGovernance\\n\\n1 0\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance\\nIntroduction\\n\\nManagement  involvement\\n\\nAt Tesla,  sustainability  is everyone's  job regardless of their position,  geographic  location  or title. Our \\nSustainability  Council, made up of leaders  from across Tesla,  collects data and prepares the analysis and \\ncontent of this report. The Sustainability  Council also presents  this information  to Tesla’s  Board of Directors  for \\nreview.\\n\\nBoard of Directors  oversight\\n\\nThe Board of Directors  serves  as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders  and oversees  the management  of Tesla’s \\nbusiness — including reviewing  the effectiveness  of Tesla’s  Impact priorities,  initiatives  and programs  and this \\nreport. With those responsibilities  in mind, the Board sets high standards for Tesla  and its employees,  officers \\nand directors; and we periodically  add new,  highly qualified  independent directors  to the Board, such as Larry \\nEllison  and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson  in 2018 and Hiromichi Mizuno  in 2020. Implicit in this approach is the \\nimportance  of sound corporate  governance.\\n\\n1 1\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance \\nIntroduction\\n\\nSound corporate  governance  is critical to our mission. We are committed  to establishing an operating \\nframework  that exercises  appropriate  oversight  of responsibilities  at all levels  throughout the company and \\nmanages its affairs consistent with high principles  of business ethics.\\n\\nTesla  aspires to be a “do the right thing” company. Our Code of Business Ethics sets out basic principles that \\nshould help anyone  working  at or for Tesla avoid even  the appearance of improper  behavior. Tesla’s  Code  of \\nBusiness Ethics and our Corporate  Governance  Guidelines  are available  on Tesla’s  website.\\n\\nIn addition, we believe  in regular and transparent  communication  with employees.  We encourage  Tesla \\nemployees  to share their feedback openly  (and anonymously,  if they prefer), and provide  easy methods  to do \\nso. We also regularly conduct employee  surveys  to identify strengths and opportunities  for improvement.  We \\nhave a robust action planning process to ensure we proactively  address the concerns or feedback.\\n\\nWe also have a whistleblower  hotline through which employees  can report  concerns at any time. Tesla  keeps \\ninformation  reported by employees  in confidence, whether through the hotline or another  channel. Our policies \\nprohibit retaliatory  actions against employees  for raising concerns or making complaints. We are committed  to \\nmaintaining an open and transparent culture where it is safe and acceptable for all employees  to raise  concerns \\nabout policy violations  by their manager or colleagues  or about the workplace  overall.\\n\\n1 2\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance\\nOur Approach\\n\\n1 3\\n\\nOur unique business requires a unique approach to corporate  governance.  And our mission  requires a long-term \\nfocus that we believe  will ultimately  maximize  value to our employees  and our stockholders. Our corporate \\ngovernance  structure has facilitated several  key decisions  which might have appeared counter-intuitive  to some, \\nbut which have set up the Tesla  to achieve  long-term  success. Some examples  include our decisions  to:\\n\\n• Manufacture all-electric  vehicles  (EVs) from the ground up rather than being a mere supplier  of EV \\n\\ncomponents\\n\\n• Establish an international  network  of our own stores, service centers and Supercharger stations  despite \\n\\nregulatory hurdles and the significant  capital outlay required to do so\\n\\n• Build Gigafactory  1, the largest lithium-ion  battery factory in the world,  so that we can scale most effectively\\n\\n• Expand into energy generation  and storage  through the acquisition of SolarCity  Corporation  in 2016  to \\n\\ncreate a vertically  integrated sustainable energy company and empower  individual consumers  to be their \\nown utility\\n\\n• Deploy  FSD city streets beta software to our fleet to develop  complete Full Self-Driving  capability  in the \\n\\nfuture\\n\\n• Compensate  our CEO only if other shareholders  realize tremendous  value\\n\\nThese and other similar  decisions  were made due to our corporate  governance  structure and, ultimately, \\ndecisions  like these are what differentiate  Tesla from other  companies and are a significant  reason why the \\nannualized stockholder  return since our 2010 IPO until December  31, 2021 equaled 65%.  At the same time, the \\nBoard continuously  evaluates  our corporate  governance  structure, practices and policies,  and weighs \\nstakeholder  feedback including proposals  we have historically  received  at our annual meetings. For example,  at \\nour 2021 annual meeting  of stockholders,  the Board proposed  and recommended that stockholders  adopt an \\namendment  to our certificate of incorporation to reduce the term of our directors to two  years. However,  our \\nstockholders  did not approve  that proposal.\\n\\nThe Board is directly and regularly engaged with senior management  and the Sustainability  Council  and \\nparticipates in robust shareholder  outreach and feedback. In addition, our directors  have significant experience \\nas either top-level  executives  at public companies, as successful investors or as entrepreneurs  who founded \\nsuccessful organizations.\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance \\nBoard Committees (as of March 1, 2022)\\n\\nCommittees  of the Board\\n\\nRobyn Denholm\\n\\n2014\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nBoard role in risk oversight\\n\\n \\n\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\ns\\nn\\ne\\np\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\ns\\nl\\no\\nr\\nt\\nn\\no\\nC\\n \\ne\\nr\\nu\\ns\\no\\nc\\ns\\ni\\nD\\n\\nl\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\n\\n&\\n\\n \\n\\ng\\nn\\ni\\nt\\na\\nn\\nm\\no\\nN\\n\\ni\\n\\n \\ne\\nc\\nn\\na\\nn\\nr\\ne\\nv\\no\\nG\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nName\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nYear \\njoined\\n\\nElon Musk\\n\\nIra Ehrenpreis\\n\\nLarry Ellison\\n\\nHiromichi \\nMizuno\\n\\nIndependent \\nBoard chair\\n\\nDirector and \\nCEO\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2004\\n\\n2007\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2017\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n \\nt\\ni\\n\\nd\\nu\\nA\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nJames Murdoch\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nKimbal Musk\\n\\nDirector\\n\\n2004\\n\\nKathleen \\nWilson-\\nThompson\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2018\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nThe Board has four standing committees — the Audit Committee,  the Compensation  Committee,  the \\nNominating  and Corporate  Governance  Committee  and the Disclosure  Controls  Committee — which are each \\nfurther described  in the following  pages.

In addition, as part of our governance  review  and succession \\nplanning, the Board (led by the Nominating  and Corporate  Governance  Committee)  evaluates  our leadership \\nstructure to ensure that it remains the optimal  structure for Tesla, reviews  the composition,  size and \\nperformance  of the Board and its committees,  evaluates  individual directors  and identifies  and evaluates \\ncandidates for election  or re-election  to the Board. Committee  charters were  updated in 2021 to reflect the \\ngrowing  risks and opportunities  around ESG.\\n\\nThe Board is responsible  for overseeing  the major risks facing Tesla,  while management  is responsible  for \\nassessing and mitigating Tesla’s  risks on a day-to-day basis. In addition, the Board has delegated oversight  of \\ncertain categories of  risk to its independent  committees,  which then report  to the Board, as appropriate, on \\nmatters that involve  the specific areas of risk that each committee  oversees.\\n\\n1 4\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance \\nBoard Committees (as of March 1, 2022)\\n\\nAudit Committee \\n\\nRobyn Denholm\\n\\n2014\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nCompensation  Committee\\n\\n \\n\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\ns\\nn\\ne\\np\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\ns\\nl\\no\\nr\\nt\\nn\\no\\nC\\n \\ne\\nr\\nu\\ns\\no\\nc\\ns\\ni\\nD\\n\\nl\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\n \\n\\n&\\n\\n \\n\\ng\\nn\\ni\\nt\\na\\nn\\nm\\no\\nN\\n\\ni\\n\\n \\ne\\nc\\nn\\na\\nn\\nr\\ne\\nv\\no\\nG\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nName\\n\\nFunction\\n\\nYear \\njoined\\n\\nElon Musk\\n\\nIra Ehrenpreis\\n\\nLarry Ellison\\n\\nHiromichi \\nMizuno\\n\\nIndependent \\nBoard chair\\n\\nDirector and \\nCEO\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\nIndependent \\ndirector\\n\\n2004\\n\\n2007\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2017\\n\\ne\\ne\\nt\\nt\\ni\\n\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\n \\nt\\ni\\n\\nd\\nu\\nA\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nX\\n\\nThe Audit Committee  is responsible  for, among other things, assisting the Board in providing  oversight  of \\nTesla’s  accounting and financial reporting  processes and the audit of its financial statements,  including \\noversight  over  the integrity  of such statements, the Company’s  compliance with legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, the independent auditor’s  qualifications,  independence and performance,  the organization  and \\nperformance  of the Company’s  internal audit function, as well  as the Company’s  internal accounting and \\nfinancial controls, treasury and finance matters,  risk management,  including data privacy  and cybersecurity.

Since these awards increase in value  as our stock price increases (and in the case of \\nstock option  awards, have no value unless our stock price increases following  their grant), our named executive \\nofficers’  incentives  are closely  aligned with the long-term  interests of our stockholders.\\n\\nTesla  has no cash bonus program  for any of our named executive  officers  and generally  does not provide  any \\nperquisites or tax reimbursements  to our named executive  officers  that are not available to other employees.  No \\nnamed executive  officer  has any severance  or change of control arrangement,  except as reflected  in Elon Musk’s \\nperformance-based  2018 CEO Performance  Award.  A change in control modifies  the vesting  requirements of \\nthe 2018  CEO Performance  Award such that vesting of the Award’s tranches would  be measured based on \\nTesla’s  market  capitalization  at the time of the change of the control, without  regard to the operational \\nmilestones  of the Award. Elon Musk, our Chief  Executive  Officer, historically  earned a base salary that reflected \\nthe applicable  minimum wage requirements  under California  law, and he was subject to income taxes based on \\nsuch base salary.  However,  he has never  accepted his salary. Commencing  in May 2019  at Mr. Musk’s request, we \\neliminated  altogether  the earning and accrual of this base salary. Consequently,  100% of Mr. Musk’s \\ncompensation  is at-risk.\\n\\nSimilarly,  the compensation  program  for Tesla’s  non-employee  directors  is designed to be consistent with our \\ncompensation  philosophy  for our employees,  with an emphasis  on equity-based  compensation  over  cash in \\norder to align the value  of their compensation  with the market  value of our stock, and consequently,  with the \\nlong-term  interests of our stockholders.  Moreover,  while we  offer to our general employee  population  restricted \\nstock units that will retain some  value even  if the market value  of our stock decreases, the equity-based \\ncompensation  to our directors has been exclusively  in the form  of stock options,  which have zero initial value \\nand accumulate value, if at all, only to the extent that our stock price increases following  their grant, through \\nthe applicable  vesting dates and until such stock options  are ultimately  exercised  and the underlying shares are \\nsold. The remaining portion  of  our directors’  compensation  has been comprised of cash retainer  payments that \\nare relatively  modest  compared to peer companies and that may be waived at the election  of each \\ndirector. Further, in June 2021, the Board adopted a resolution  that all existing directors  forego any automatic \\ngrants of annual stock option  awards under our director compensation  policy  until July 2022  unless the Board \\ndetermines  otherwise. \\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\nTesla  builds products with privacy and security  at their core\\n\\nWe believe  that responsible  data management  and transparency is a prerequisite  for continuous innovation.  We \\nlive up to this commitment  by providing  information  and controls in our products that let you  choose  how your \\npersonal  data is collected  and used.\\n\\nManaging data privacy is a shared task through all levels  of our organization\\n\\nData privacy is a shared responsibility  in which every  employee  and our Board is expected to participate. Tesla \\nhas a large and diverse  team of privacy  and security professionals  from all over  the world  and across legal, \\nengineering  and product organizations,  who are dedicated to protecting customer data. Additionally,  the Audit \\nCommittee  of the Tesla Board of Directors  is regularly  briefed on incidents, emerging  trends, controls and \\ncorrective  actions taken by Tesla  to ensure we are living up to our obligations  and Privacy  Principles.\\n\\nTesla’s  Privacy  Principles\\n\\nTesla  is guided not only  legally by its obligations  under global privacy laws and regulations,  but also by \\ncustomer expectations  and our Privacy Principles.\\n\\nWe do the right thing with data. We maintain trust by handling data as customers  expect, keeping it accurate \\nand complete  and properly  destroying  it when it is no longer  needed.\\n\\n• We build privacy  into our products from start to finish. Ensuring privacy  is an important  component  when \\n\\nbuilding world-class  products and services, from  inception to rollout  and beyond.\\n\\n• We give customers choices about their data. We put individuals in control by giving them clear and \\n\\ntransparent ways to access, review,  manage and delete their data with ease.\\n\\n• We maintain trust through transparency. We are clear about the personal  data we collect and how  we're \\n\\nusing or sharing it – ensuring that choosing a connected vehicle  does not come at the sacrifice of customer \\nprivacy.\\n\\n• We safeguard personal  data. We implement  rigorous  controls and standards designed to protect the security, \\n\\nconfidentiality  and integrity of Tesla’s  data environment.\\n\\n1 7\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance\\nData Privacy and Cybersecurity\\n\\nPrivacy from  day one\\n\\nTesla’s  Privacy  Principles and commitments  are illustrated  throughout all our products. For Tesla  vehicles, \\ncustomer personal  data is protected from the moment  they  take delivery,  ensuring that by default the vehicle \\ndata generated  when driving is not associated  with the customer's account or vehicle  identification  number. \\nTesla  also puts customers  in the driver’s  seat when it comes to data sharing by providing  a dedicated in-vehicle \\nmenu to adjust preferences at any time.\\n\\nAdditionally,  from  Powerwall  to Solar  Roof, energy products are designed  to protect customer privacy.  Tesla \\naims to collect  a minimum amount of personal  data necessary in providing  the most engaging in-app energy \\nexperience.  In furtherance  of transparency, Tesla  has developed  a seamless  way for customers  to download  and \\naccess their energy data at any time right from  the Tesla  app.\\n\\nEngaging the security community\\n\\nWe are also focused on ensuring that our vehicles are the most secure on the road. To  do that, our team of \\nworld-class  engineers works  day in and day out to ensure that our systems are always as secure as possible. \\nAnd while some of the best security  engineers work  at Tesla,  we believe  that in order to design and build \\ninherently secure systems, we cannot work  alone. We work  closely  with the security research community to \\nbenefit  from their collective  expertise  and diversity  of thought.\\n\\nContinuous  product improvement\\n\\nTesla  pioneered  the concept of vehicles  that improve  and become more capable over  time by ensuring that \\nevery  Tesla  vehicle  made since 2012 can accept over-the-air  (OTA) software  updates. These updates have \\nintroduced new features and functionality  that have made our vehicles  smarter, safer and more enjoyable  to \\ndrive. We have also used the OTA  system to ensure that our vehicles  are not only as secure as possible  when \\nthey are delivered,  but that they continue to stay as secure as possible  throughout their lifetime.\\n\\n1 8\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate Governance\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nHuman rights are core to our mission of  a sustainable  future\\n\\nThe ethical treatment  of all people  and regard for human rights is core to our mission  of a sustainable future. \\nWe believe  all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility  to share our respect for human rights. \\nOur human rights policy is the formalization  of our commitment  to uphold and respect these rights and the \\nvalues they  represent.\\n\\nWe endorse  and base our definition  of human rights on the United Nation's Universal  Declaration  for Human \\nRights (UDHR). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect and equality, without  discrimination,  for all people. We \\nare committed  to upholding these  rights and values  throughout our value chain — including with respect to our \\nemployees,  customers, shareholders,  suppliers  and the communities  in which we  operate. We require that our \\nsuppliers will also  support and promote  these values in their own  operations  and in those of their own suppliers.\\n\\nAddressing  human rights risks is an ongoing effort,  involving  engagement with our value chain for potential \\nimpacts, incorporating  input from external stakeholders  and reviewing  and updating our own  policies  where \\nnecessary. With this understanding, Tesla  is committed  to addressing any potential  human rights issues both \\nwithin our own operations  and those of our value chain.\\n\\nYou can see our full Human Rights policy  here.\\n\\n1 9\\n\\n\\x0cWe have a zero-tolerance  policy  when it comes  to child or forced labor and human trafficking  by our suppliers\\n\\nAt Tesla,  we are committed  to ensuring that the way we conduct our business and dealings with our suppliers \\nreflects our values  and our belief  that everyone  should be treated with dignity and respect. Tesla  is committed \\nto ensuring that our suppliers  do not use slave or child labor or engage in human trafficking.  Modern slavery, \\nchild labor and human trafficking  are crimes under the laws of countries throughout the world,  but \\nunfortunately  continue to exist all over  the globe. Our commitment  on this front is summarized  in our Supplier \\nCode  of Conduct as well  as in our Human Rights Policy and Responsible  Materials  Policy, and we continue to \\nwork  to ensure that our suppliers uphold the principles  in these statements. We look  to the Organization for \\nEconomic Co-operation  and Development  (OECD)  Due Diligence Guidelines  to inform our process and use \\nfeedback from our internal and external stakeholders  to find ways to continually improve  it.\\n\\nThrough our commitment  to enforce our Supplier Code  of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and Responsible \\nMaterials  Policy, continuous training and the supplier audit and due diligence efforts,  Tesla  believes  that there is \\nlow  risk of, and have found no evidence to date of Tesla  causing, contributing to or being linked to modern \\nslavery,  child labor or human trafficking  in our supply chain.\\n\\nFor more information  on our commitment  to anti-slavery  practices and an affirmation  of the values we hold and \\nadopt across Tesla’s  business operations  and supply chain, including how we assess risks and effectiveness  of \\nour actions, please see our California  Transparency  in Supply Chain Acts  Statement and our U.K. Modern  Slavery \\nAct Transparency  Statement.\\n\\nCorporate Governance\\nHuman Rights\\n\\n2 0\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and\\nCulture\\n\\n2 1\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nIntroduction\\n\\nWhat do we  see as impact?\\n\\nOur employees  have gotten us to where we are today. To continue innovating  and changing the world  for the \\nbetter, we must ensure we have a talented and engaged workforce  with ample  opportunity  to contribute to our \\nmission  and grow professionally.\\n\\nMeaningful  work: Working  for Tesla is not just any job. The products we build are necessary  for transitioning  to \\na sustainable future.\\n\\nRespectful,  safe, inclusive  and equitable  workplace:  Tesla  is a majority-minority  company. We strive  to be a \\nworkplace  where people  love  to come to work every  day. While challenges will arise, Tesla  has a zero-tolerance \\npolicy for harassment  of any kind, and we will continue to address them head on as we keep growing.\\n\\nWe hire a lot: We created nearly 100,000 direct new jobs in a decade. While many manufacturers are trimming \\ntheir operations,  we are growing  as quickly as is feasible.\\n\\nPay well: We want to make sure that we pay competitive  wages, regardless of the region.\\n\\nSignificant upside potential:  Every single employee  of our company can receive their grants in stocks or \\noptions.  If our company does well, every  employee  can benefit  materially  from Tesla’s  success.\\n\\nOutstanding benefits: We want our benefits  to be an outlier in the manufacturing industry. Among other \\nbenefits,  we provide  medical, dental and vision  plans with no paycheck deductions, 401k matching, life \\ninsurance, parental leave and family building benefits.\\n\\nBuild the future: Who wouldn’t want to work  for a company with a mission  of building a future we all want? \\nTesla’s  mission  is not only about making a product that people  love,  but also about making a real, sustained \\nimpact on transitioning  the world  to sustainable energy. In 2021, we received 3,000,000 job applications  from \\nthose wanting to be a part of this mission.\\n\\n2 2\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #1: Attracting\\n\\nNearly  100,000 direct jobs in a decade — and we continue to hire extensively\\n\\nOur employee  count has grown ~70 fold  over  the past decade and, in just over  ten years, Tesla  has created \\nnearly 100,000 direct jobs. While  many companies in the automotive  industry have been trimming the number \\nof employees  and launching early retirement  programs, we  plan to grow  our employee  base for years to come.\\n\\nAs we are aiming to produce over  20x more cars by 2030 than we did in 2021,  we will need to continue to build \\nnew factories  and hire for those new locations.  Gigafactories  in Texas and Berlin  will recruit extensively  starting \\nthis year,  which means that our job creation will continue to expand for quite some  time. \\n\\nTesla Global  Employee  Count\\n\\n100,000\\n\\n80,000\\n\\n60,000\\n\\n40,000\\n\\n20,000\\n\\n0\\n\\n2 3\\n\\n2010\\n\\n2011\\n\\n2012\\n\\n2013\\n\\n2014\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #1: Attracting\\n\\nNumber  of applicants continues to break records\\n\\nBy attracting,  developing  and retaining excellent  talent, we've  developed  a pipeline  of diverse  and exceptional \\ncandidates while fostering an inclusive  culture that supports  them once they become  employees.\\n\\nWhether  it is through our direct hiring opportunities,  internships or workforce  development  programs, interest \\nin joining Tesla’s  mission is at an all-time high. We had more than 3,000,000 unique applicants globally  in 2021 \\nalone.\\n\\nWe expanded access to hiring opportunities  for underrepresented  communities  by centering diversity,  equity \\nand inclusion (DEI) in our hiring process. We did so by increasing gender-neutral  language in our job \\ndescriptions,  broadening our sourcing efforts,  revamping  interviewing  guides, building community partnerships, \\neducating on unconscious bias and facilitating training for recruiters, hiring managers and interview  panelists.\\n\\nGlobal Number Of Applicants Per Year\\n\\n3,500,000\\n\\n3,000,000\\n\\n2,500,000\\n\\n2,000,000\\n\\n1,500,000\\n\\n1,000,000\\n\\n500,000\\n\\n0\\n\\n2 4\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #1: Attracting\\n\\nEngineers want to work  for Tesla\\n\\nAccording to Universum 2021  rankings, engineering students want to work for Tesla  and SpaceX more than any \\nother organization.\\n\\nMany successful companies with great engineering  can become bureaucratic over  time.

We \\nhave long stated publicly that candidates do not need to have a college  degree to work at Tesla.  This represents \\nan enormous  opportunity  for high school  graduates from underserved  communities  to join us in our mission and \\ngrow their careers.\\n\\nManufacturing Development  Program\\n\\nThis is a two-year  program  where recent high school graduates in the U.S. start a career at Tesla  as a production \\nassociate while continuing their education in automation  and robotics  at a local community  college. Since its \\nlaunch in 2017, we've  hired 168  graduates into this program,  with active  programs at Gigafactory  Nevada, \\nGigafactory  New  York and our Fremont  Factory. We also launched our first Manufacturing Development \\nProgram  class with Del Valle High School  to support  Gigafactory  Texas  in fall 2021. \\n\\nTool  & Die Apprenticeship \\n\\nIn partnership with local community  colleges, Tesla  offers  a federal  and state certified  Tool  & Die Apprenticeship \\nprogram  in the U.S. at the Fremont  Factory,  Gigafactory  Nevada  and Tesla  Grand Rapids. These apprenticeships \\nblend on-the-job  training by qualified  mentors with classroom  learning, providing a holistic  approach to \\nlearning a trade in high demand. Apprentices learn welding,  machining, blueprint reading and other critical \\nskills. Similar  programs run in Europe, including at the Gigafactory  Berlin where we collaborate  with local \\nvocational  schools  and train students via facilitated workshops,  self-led  modules  and on-the-job  exercises  for a \\nvariety  of roles.\\n\\n2 6\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #1: Attracting\\n\\nIntroduce a Girl to Engineering Day & National  Manufacturing Day\\n\\nTo  promote gender diversity  in STEM, since 2018, Tesla  has encouraged  girls to see engineering  as a means to\\npursue their goals by participating in Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. This year,  over  1,200 middle school \\nstudents from 140 schools  across California,  Nevada,  Texas  and New York joined the virtual event  which \\nshowcased  a variety  of engineering  career pathways and inspiring female Tesla  engineers  through virtual tours, \\nengaging videos and hands-on STEM  activities. Similar  initiatives  take place in Europe, like Girls’  Day, which is \\ndedicated to girls who want to explore  future career paths in the industry. Our aim is to encourage  and inspire \\nthem via factory tour visits and conversations  with our female  employees  and leaders.\\n\\nInternship program\\n\\nK-12  education in Nevada\\n\\nOur internship program  continues to be our driving force in attracting diverse  entry level  professional  talent. In \\nour effort  to expand access to our program,  we attended more than 75 diversity  hiring events  targeting women \\nand students of Historically  Black Colleges  and Universities,  Hispanic Serving  Institutions, and launched new \\ncommunity  Internship Initiatives with  Say Yes Buffalo, Breakthrough Austin, TRiO Scholars  in Nevada  and \\nCollege  Track  in the Bay Area to increase diversity  in our program. \\n\\nAs part of our agreement  to build Gigafactory  Nevada,  we committed  to invest $37.5M  into K-12  education \\nbeginning in 2018. This investment  is in partnership with the Department  of Education and the Education Gift \\nFund, with a focus on initiatives  that support the acceleration  of robotics, STEAM  and sustainability \\nprogramming.  To  date, $22.5M has been invested across 30 organizations  and an additional  $17M  planned in \\n2022-2023. \\n\\nConference  spotlight:  Society  of Hispanic Professional  Engineers\\n\\nThe SHPE National  Convention  serves  as the country’s  largest annual gathering of Hispanic STEM students and \\nprofessionals.  We met over  3,000 students from  various disciplines  and had the opportunity  to build some \\ngreat relationships  along the way with various  SHPE chapter leaders  in the country. Tesla’s  DEI team also \\nparticipated in the SHPETina series  during the conference, which is a program that accelerates and affirms \\nLatina representation  at all levels  of STEM  corporate  and academic leadership.\\n\\n2 7\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #2: Compensating\\n\\nExceeding comparable  manufacturing role compensation\\n\\nTesla  provides  a highly competitive  wage that meets or exceeds  the wages of comparable  manufacturing roles, \\neven  before equity and benefits  are factored in. In 2021,  Tesla’s  average  national wage for manufacturing jobs in \\nthe U.S. was $21.60/hour  plus benefits  (which, among others  listed on the next page, includes an option  for $0 \\ncost paycheck deductions) and equity, which is a 2.2%  increase compared to 2020. According to the Bureau of \\nLabor Statistics, the mean hourly  wage for Production  Associates  / Assemblers  is $18.17  and the median is \\n$17.59. Tesla  continuously  reviews  salary and wages against benchmarks and adjusts to ensure wages are \\ncompetitive.  Evaluations  for promotions  also take place annually.\\n\\nThe impact of stock-based compensation  can be material for employees\\n\\nOur employees  have benefited  enormously  from value appreciation  of our stock seen through the years. While \\nshare prices will remain volatile  and past performance  is not indicative  of future results, stock-based \\ncompensation  brings shared ownership  to the workforce,  and our employees  are encouraged  to make  a positive \\nchange for the benefit of all. Culturally,  shared ownership  of the company is one of the most essential  attributes \\nof working  at Tesla. \\n\\nFor example, assume that an employee  received a grant of 320 Tesla  shares in 2018 that vested 20 shares \\nquarterly over  16 quarters (4 years). Based on the stock price at the time of the grant, the quarterly  vest of 20 \\nTesla  shares would  equate to $1,331-worth  of sellable  shares at the end of 2018. However,  the same vest two \\nyears  later would  equate to $14,113-worth  of sellable  shares per quarter based on the increase in the price per \\nshare of Tesla  stock over  that period. Employees  are also eligible  to buy additional stock at a discount through \\nthe Employee  Stock Purchase Program.\\n\\nValue Creation  at TSLA, Contributed  to by 10,000s of Employees,  Had Material Compensation  Impact\\n\\ne\\nc\\ni\\nr\\nP\\n \\ne\\nr\\na\\nh\\nS\\n\\n$1,400\\n\\n$1,200\\n\\n$1,000\\n\\n$800\\n\\n$600\\n\\n$400\\n\\n$200\\n\\n$0\\n\\n2 8\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nOur Plan #2: Compensating\\n\\nCommitted  to ensuring pay equity\\n\\nTesla  HR offers  a Pay Equity & Pay Transparency  educational course to everyone  in the People  Organization, \\nwith a focus on HR partners and recruiters.

Our early years  of Model 3 production  and global expansion  were some  of \\nthe most  difficult in our history and our employee  satisfaction ratings  (Glassdoor)  reflected that.\\n\\nOur company is in a different  phase now.  Model  3 has become the best-selling  premium sedan globally  and \\nprofitability  (operating  margin) rose  to the highest in the industry. This has fueled  our ability  to expand \\ndramatically  and provide  career opportunities  for many strong performers.  Compensation,  linked to the \\nperformance  of the company, also improved  substantially  in recent years. \\n\\nThere’s still a lot of work  to be done, predominantly  when it comes to work-life  balance. Our goals have always \\nbeen, and still are, bold. Expectations  are understandably  high as a result. We recently introduced unlimited \\nvacation  for salaried employees  and added more  family benefits.

These ensure that we identify \\ntrends across functions instead of simply looking  at our workforce  at the company-wide level.  Executives  review \\norganizational  demographics  and work  with their DEI, HR and Recruiting partners to create an action plan to \\nattract, develop  and retain talent.\\n\\nThat same year,  we also took steps to incorporate  DEI principles into talent management. The fundamental pillar \\nin this strategy is consistent and fair performance  reviews  — a reliable review  process leads to more equitable \\naccess to internal opportunities.  Since 2020, we have routinely delivered  performance  reviews  to over  99%  of all \\nemployees  globally.  The program  has led to improvements  in our internal mobility  program and employees' \\naccess to career opportunities  within Tesla.\\n\\nWe expanded our leadership  development  team with a focus on providing DEI offerings  to all our U.S. \\nemployees.  Now  all employees  are introduced to our DEI principles on their first day as part of orientation  and \\ncan continue their DEI learning journey  throughout their time at Tesla.  From  our allyship resources, to DEI Life \\nHacks on our DEI Knowledge  Center,  to virtual instructor led courses on unconscious bias, inclusive  interviewing \\nand inclusive leadership,  our employees  have access to information  no matter where they are.\\n\\nOur Diversity,  Equity and Inclusion principles\\n\\nOur DEI team uses a people-first  and data-driven  approach to champion diversity,  equity  and inclusion  in our \\nbusiness and in the communities  in which we operate. We rely on the following  guiding principles:\\n\\n• Provide  transparency in our DEI programs,  identify  areas of improvement,  celebrate successes and \\n\\ncontinually iterate  and improve  our DEI approach\\n\\n•\\n\\nIntegrate accountability measures  into our business operations\\n\\n• Focus on sustainable solutions  that solve  problems  at the root cause and reimagine  new programs  with DEI \\n\\nprinciples embedded  in the design\\n\\ndevelopment\\n\\n• Share knowledge  throughout all levels  of the organization  to aid in personal and professional  learning and \\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\\n\\nDiversity  data (EEO-1) for U.S. employees:  Tesla  is a majority-minority  company\\n\\nWe are proud to be a majority-minority  company with a large representation  of employees  from communities \\nthat have long struggled  to break through the historic roadblocks  to equal opportunity  in the U.S. As of \\nDecember  31, 2020, 34% of our directors  and vice presidents  were non-white.

Specifically,  we expanded our Employee  Resource Groups (ERGs) and \\nensured our programming  was accessible in a remote  work  environment. We welcomed  Asian Pacific Islanders \\nat Tesla  to our ERG family. While  this was a time of uncertainty and change, through our ERGs, we ensured our \\nemployees  felt more heard and connected than ever  before as they  pivoted to virtual events  to promote \\ninclusion across different locations,  physical boundaries  and time zones.\\n\\nAt Tesla,  we strive  to have a diverse  supply chain and create the maximum practical opportunities  to provide \\ngoods  and services as a part of the corporate  procurement  process. We formalized  collaboration  between  the \\nDEI, Supply Chain and Government  Affairs teams to ensure local minority,  women,  LGBTQ+, disabled  and \\nveteran  owned  businesses are connected to opportunities  with Tesla. We recognize that supplier diversity \\ncreates a competitive  advantage  for the company and has a positive  impact on the global  community. As the \\nsupplier diversity  program develops,  we  will implement  plans that encourage  increased usage of diverse \\nsuppliers throughout  our organization,  partner with internal and external  stakeholders  to identify  opportunities \\nfor diverse  suppliers  and work with external partners  to encourage  capacity building for diverse  suppliers.\\n\\nIntersectionality\\n\\n4 1\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nWe strive to create an environment  where people  love  to come to work  every  day. With over  100,000 \\nemployees  as of March 2022,  challenges arise, and we address them head on.\\n\\nIn 2021, we re-doubled  our efforts  to educate employees  and managers that any form  of discrimination  must be \\nreported. While  our goal is always prevention,  reported  complaints of discrimination  and harassment are \\npromptly  investigated and if substantiated, subject to discipline up to and including termination.  New \\nemployees  receive anti-harassment  and discrimination  training during orientation.  A new employee  guidebook \\nwas also rolled  out which instructs employees  to report all forms of misconduct without  concern. \\n\\nAs the company continues to hire tens of thousands of workers  per year, educating our workforce  is a top \\npriority  and an ongoing  process.\\n\\n4 2\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nHow  we're meeting our commitments  to equal opportunity  employment  and a diverse  and inclusive \\nenvironment\\n\\nWe believe  it’s essential  to provide all employees  with a respectful  and safe working  environment  where all \\nemployees  can achieve their potential.  As a result, we do not tolerate  discrimination,  harassment  or any \\nmistreatment  of employees  in the workplace  or work-related  situations. Below  are some of the actions we are \\ntaking to ensure the proper treatment of all employees.\\n\\nTraining:  Code of Business  Ethics and harassment  & discrimination training for front-line  leaders, HR partners \\nand other employees  to understand how  to create and promote  a respectful  workplace, assess situations  sooner \\nand escalate appropriately.\\n\\nInternal Tracking  System Enhancement: An enhancement to our internal tracking system now allows  HR to \\ndocument all employee  concerns that are raised  to ensure there is follow  through and resolution  for tracking \\npurposes.  Additionally,  handling concerns at the initial stage helps prevent  them from  becoming bigger issues. \\nThe case management  system also allows  the appropriate teams to review  data to trend and issue spot, which \\nthen can lead to proactive  solutions  before  concerns arise.\\n\\nInternal Mobility:  A program that advocates for and provides  equal access to employee  advancement \\nopportunities  and retention with eligibility  for opportunities  based on standardized performance  reviews. \\nOpportunities  are advertised  on an internal site with career resources in addition to a monthly  newsletter. We \\nalso offer  1-on-1  support  and personal  consultations  to understand the career aspirations  of internal applicants.\\n\\nThird-party managed integrity  line\\n\\nWe encourage employees  to raise concerns internally or externally.  An employee  can raise concerns or \\ncomplaints  to any member  of management, Human Resources or Employee  Relations  (ER). If they prefer to \\nreport another  way, the Integrity Line is available 24  hours a day, seven  days a week. The Integrity Line allows \\nemployees  to report  concerns anonymously  and without fear of retaliation.\\n\\nIf any employee  raises a good  faith concern, HR, together with ER, will ensure that employee  concerns are \\ninvestigated promptly  and impartially  in a manner appropriate  to the circumstances. The Employee  Relations \\nteam engages in feedback loops  with leaders  and HR to provide  guidance on any appropriate follow-up  actions, \\nwhich range from additional  communication  and training to corrective  action and discipline up to termination  of \\nemployment.\\n\\n4 3\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nEmployee Engagement\\n\\nWhy engagement matters  for retention\\n\\nEmployee  engagement  drives  productivity,  satisfaction and loyalty  and plays a critical role in employee \\nretention. Tesla’s  engagement initiatives  strive to make employees  feel informed,  valued and respected, while \\ncompany-wide open-door  policies  with leaders  empower  employees  to make  their ideas heard. When we feel \\nconnected to the Tesla community  and mission, we  unlock our full potential as a workforce.\\n\\nWhat we are doing to keep employees  engaged\\n\\nTo  promote engagement,  we lead initiatives  driven  by employee  feedback. Throughout the year, we use \\nroundtables, engagement  surveys  and other feedback forms  to gather data and better understand the \\nemployee  experience.\\n\\nOur team uses this data to inform our communication  strategies.  In addition to a monthly newsletter  emailed to \\nall U.S. employees  and physically posted at manufacturing sites, we launched a new company-wide internal \\nnews platform  with weekly  updates on company news, employee  recognition and events.\\n\\nWe highlight business, people  and safety updates via both email and an expansive  network  of video  screens. In \\n2021, we also  produced two  live and virtual companywide  all-hands.\\n\\nThese channels pair with the revitalization  of daily Start-Up meetings  for assembly workers  to streamline \\ncommunications  across the Fremont  Factory.  HR members  also staff on-site  Answer  Bar kiosks to address \\nemployee  questions and concerns at many of our office locations.\\n\\nEngagement requires making resources more  accessible. This translates to regular on-site  tabling and fairs for \\nbenefits,  as well as making information  available digitally. We manage internal resource websites  for product \\nknowledge,  employee  perks, recognition,  employee  volunteering,  health and fitness  and offer virtual info \\nsessions  with subject matter experts.\\n\\n4 4\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nSupporting  Ukraine\\n\\nWe are committed  to providing  disaster relief through product donations.  Our relief efforts  to the conflict in \\nUkraine have provided people  with the ability  to communicate and power  communities. \\n\\nIn March 2022, Tesla  employees  in Europe volunteered to design, prototype and deploy  the first 50 kits \\ncontaining Powerwalls,  Gateways and solar inverters to support continued energy access in Ukraine. When \\npaired with one of the 250 solar panels dispatched by volunteers  at Gigafactory Berlin, these mini power  plants \\ncan assist Ukrainian communications and essential services indefinitely by using solar to recharge Powerwalls.\\n\\nAlong with Starlink Terminals  used for satellite internet access (made by SpaceX), the kits were shipped to the \\nUkranian border in Poland, at which point they were transferred onto military  trucks. The kit can begin providing \\npower  almost instantly, without any tools  or technical experience required. With the Powerwall  kit alone, a user \\ncan power  Starlink for five days. With solar panels installed and operational,  the kits can provide  indefinite \\npower  for Starlink Terminal,  plus a small appliance or laptop.\\n\\nSurrounding European countries\\n\\nIn addition to product donations, Tesla has opened free Supercharging at all stations in Poland, Slovakia  and \\nHungary to support those impacted by the recent events. Within hours of implementation,  Tesla  emailed local \\nowners  announcing that several  Supercharger stations near Ukraine could be used by Tesla  and non-Tesla \\nelectric vehicles, free-of-charge.\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\nHurricane Ida\\n\\nIn the aftermath  of Hurricane Ida, Tesla  worked  with NGO partners  such as the Footprint  Project, and certified \\ninstallers  in the New  Orleans Area (Solar Alternatives,  Posigen)  to deploy  Powerwall  and solar  panel disaster \\nrelief systems. We deployed  14 systems to over  10 sites, including food  distribution  centers, churches, a \\nwarehouse, a fire station, a shelter and command center for NGOs.  Most systems stayed in place for six weeks \\nwhile the grid was down;  in cases where the building was too  damaged to return power  after the grid was back \\nup the systems remained in place for substantially  longer.  Our partners estimate that these systems provided \\npower  to over  1,000 people  including recovery  workers,  food  distribution  volunteers  and first responders.\\n\\nKentucky Storms\\n\\nTexas Winter Storm\\n\\nAfter the Kentucky winter storms,  we deployed  two  systems at a research and education center in Princeton, \\nKentucky in partnership with the Footprint  Project. These systems helped power  communications  trailers  and \\nmobile  offices  for over  50 recovery  workers.  They  are still deployed  while the center is being rebuilt and we are \\nexploring  ways to turn the trailers  and mobile  offices  into a training center for future recovery  workers.\\n\\nIn February 2021,  Texas experienced  a weather  event  that caused the widespread  loss of power  for several  days \\naffecting thousands of residents.  Tesla provided  a disaster relief  system to Pathways Youth & Family  Services, \\nInc., a non-profit  social  service organization  providing  foster care, adoption  and behavioral  health services  to \\ncommunities  across Texas. The system consisted of four mobile  Powerwall  units (for a total of  ~100kWh of \\nbatteries  and 40kW  of power). With this system, Pathways was able to restore heat and power  to its facilities, \\nenabling it to resume housing and other  social services  to children.\\n\\n4 6\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nSafety\\n\\n47\\n\\nIn 2021, our focus remained on protecting people,  the planet, our property  and products. We were able to \\nimprove  our performance  in Environmental,  Health, Safety  and Security (EHS&S) by turning to the experts  in \\nTesla  – our own  employees.  We evolved  the way we define safety,  developed  internal tools to drive execution, \\nactively  sought worker  improvement  suggestions  and established  a more structured EHS&S  audit program  to \\nidentify  safeguards and drive operational  excellence  throughout all areas of the business.\\n\\nOur EHS&S strategy  remains focused on three pillars:\\n\\n1. Do the Basics Right | 2. Engage and Empower  Our Stakeholders | 3. Reduce Risk\\n\\nChanging how we define  safety and build capacity: Human and Organizational  Performance  (HOP) and \\nOperational  Learning\\n\\nAs we grew and evolved  as an EHS&S  organization,  so did our view of safety. The Human and Organizational \\nPerformance  (HOP) and Operational  Learning group was developed  in 2021 to integrate our new view of safety \\ninto the organization.\\n\\nIn an ever-changing  and dynamic work environment,  we recognized the need to focus on creating the ability to \\nfail safely. Creating the ability to fail safely is comprised  of three components:\\n\\n1. Engaged workers: workers  who are connected to and care about the work  they do. When workers  are \\n\\nengaged, they are more likely  to identify and communicate  vulnerabilities  in the system.\\n\\n2. Agility:  the ability to continuously  navigate and adapt in an ever-changing,  complex  and dynamic work \\n\\n3. Safeguards: the hardware, software  and human actions that directly prevent  an event  or mitigate a bad \\n\\nenvironment.\\n\\noutcome.\\n\\nInstead of defining safety  as the absence of accidents, we define  safety as the presence of capacity. Capacity \\ncan be defined as the ability to mitigate outcomes  and reduce system brittleness.\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nSafety – MyEHS & Take Charge\\n\\nDevelop  tools  to drive execution  of EHS&S  — MyEHS\\n\\n48,779 submissions \\n72% of submissions closed with action\\n\\nIn order to build capacity and allow  our workers  to fail safely,  we needed a more dynamic approach to how we \\ncollect and manage data that allows  us to make decisions  that reduce risk. In response  to that need, we \\ndeveloped  an internal EHS&S tool  named MyEHS to help drive execution  and improve  outcomes  by allowing  the \\nintake and visualization  of data globally. We designed and deployed  11 modules  in 2021,  allowing  us to better \\nmanage our EHS&S information,  identify emerging risks and take action to implement  improvements  suggested \\nby our employees.\\n\\nForemost  in this effort  was our improvement  suggestion  module  — Take Charge. Combined  with Action  Tracker, \\nthis module  allows  workers  to submit improvement  suggestions  in various  categories,  including environment, \\nhealth, safety, security, people  and accuracy, while connecting with their supervisors  and other  work groups to \\nidentify  and implement  solutions  to improve  the presence of safeguards.\\n\\nTake  Charge case study — Sherry Ihrig\\n\\nLeading the way with Take  Charge submissions  is Sherry  Ihrig, with over  1,800 improvement  suggestions  to \\nsafety, processes,  cost-savings and more since the program’s  start in early 2021.\\n\\n“Tesla  promotes  the concept that ‘safety is a shared responsibility,’  and the Take  Charge program truly \\nempowers  me to take a more active role in sharing that responsibility,”  Ihrig said.\\n\\n“The Take  Charge program  encourages  associates  to increase their awareness of the work  environment,”  Ihrig\\nsaid. “When  these and other potential  safety hazards are noticed and resolved,  it allows  associates  to improve \\ntheir overall  work  performance.”\\n\\nWhile Ihrig has enjoyed  many parts of her experience  at Tesla,  from teaming up with “hardworking,  outgoing \\nindividuals”  to learning how  to operate  a fire extinguisher  in emergency response  training, the most  exciting \\npart has been the Take Charge program.\\n\\nMeet Sherry  Ihrig – Take  Charge Champion\\n\\nEngaged employees  like Sherry  help Tesla  build capacity to ensure safeguards are in place and functioning, so \\nthat when we fail, we fail safely.\\n\\n4 8\\n\\n\\x0cPeople and Culture\\nSafety – Protecting our People\\n\\nCOVID-19  response \\n\\nSince the emergence of COVID-19  in 2019 and the subsequent variants, we have proactively  protected our \\nworkers.

Additionally,  we want to displace fossil-based  energy generation  with renewable energy generation. \\n\\nAs of the end of 2021, Tesla  (including SolarCity  prior to its 2016  acquisition by Tesla) has installed almost 4.0 \\nGigawatts of solar systems and cumulatively generated over  25.0 Terawatt-hours  (TWhs) of emissions-free \\nelectricity. For reference, that is more energy generated by our installations than the total energy Tesla has used \\nto run all our factories since we began producing Model  S in 2012 and electricity used to power  all of our \\nvehicles in that same period combined.\\n\\nWe are striving to always remain a net contributor to renewable energy generation.  It is our goal to eventually \\nhave all our manufacturing energy needs satisfied  through renewable sources where possible. Additionally,  we \\nare hoping to see more Tesla vehicle customers installing solar panels or Solar Roof along with a Powerwall  to \\nmeet their own  energy needs in a sustainable way.\\n\\nEnergy Generation  vs. Energy Consumption  (in TWh)\\n\\n5 6\\n\\n\\x0cIntroduction\\n\\nIn addition to an updated Lifecycle Analysis  (LCA) for Model  3 and Model  Y, we  are reporting total Scope 1 and \\nScope 2 emissions  and use-phase emissions  of our vehicles\\n\\nIn this year’s  report we are reporting  our Scope 1 (direct emissions  from our facilities) and Scope 2 (purchased \\nelectricity,  heat, etc. for our facilities)  emissions  resulting from global operations.  This information  is not only \\nimportant  to benchmark our performance  against other manufacturers but is also  the first step to track \\nprogress as we continue to work to decarbonize  our own operations.  While the most important  work  we can do \\nto reduce GHG emissions  is through selling as many of our products as possible,  we are also committed  to \\nreducing carbon emitted from  our own  operations  longer term. This is not only the right thing to do, but it also \\nmakes business sense as we  reduce the resource intensity of our processes. \\n\\nIt is possible  to fully decarbonize  the manufacturing and use of EVs – this is economically  unfeasible for ICE \\nvehicles\\n\\nWe are often asked if electric vehicles  (EVs) are more sustainable  than internal combustion  engine (ICE) \\nvehicles.  The environmental  impact of zero-emission  transport  and energy products, like the products that Tesla \\nproduces and sells, is undeniably more positive  than the GHG-emitting  alternatives.  This becomes  more \\npronounced when determining  the lifetime  impact of EVs versus  ICE vehicles,  which requires looking  at the \\nentire lifecycle — from raw materials to use-phase emissions  to disposal — and not just at vehicle usage \\nemissions.\\n\\nVariables  often overlooked  by other lifecycle  studies:\\n\\n• Using Worldwide  Harmonized  Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) or Environmental Protection  Agency \\n(EPA) fuel/energy  consumption data (both of which overestimate  fuel-economy  and underestimate \\nemissions)  rather than real-world  data\\n\\n6,500 miles\\n\\nThe manufacturing  process of Model 3 and Model Y currently results \\nin slightly higher GHG emissions than an equivalent combustion \\nengine vehicle. However, based on the global weighted average grid \\nmix, Model 3 and Model Y have lower lifetime emissions  than an \\nequivalent ICE  after driving 6,500  miles.\\n\\n• Not  considering the higher energy efficiency  of Tesla’s  powertrains\\n\\n• Assuming the average  EV needs a battery replacement  at some point in its life (it doesn’t)\\n\\n• Not  considering emissions  generated  through the oil refining and the transportation  process\\n\\n• Using outdated data for the carbon impact of cell manufacturing\\n\\n5 7\\n\\n*For a definition of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions see page 135 of this report. \\n\\n\\x0cLifecycle Analysis of Tesla EVs vs.\\nEquivalent ICE Vehicles\\n\\nUsing only  real-world  data, not official  NEDC, WLPT or EPA1 consumption  data\\n\\nThe most important  variable  in a lifecycle  analysis of an automobile  is real-world  fuel consumption or electricity \\nconsumption,  as applicable, which impacts the use-phase of the lifecycle.  Various  efficiency  testing cycles such \\nas NEDC, WLTP or EPA do not truly represent real-world  fuel or energy consumption.  Therefore, we used: \\n\\nEV energy consumption:  Real world  energy consumption  based on 25 billion miles traveled  Tesla Model  3 and \\nModel  Y vehicles,  including energy losses during the charging process. \\n\\n70 tons\\nLifetime CO2e emitted by an average internal combustion engine \\nvehicle (model year 2021) sold in the U.S. through its use-phase, \\nexcluding CO2e emitted during the oil refining phase.\\n\\nICE fuel consumption:  Data provided  by Consumer  Reports,  which reports model  year 2020  mid-size  premium \\nsedans achieve  24.3 MPG on average.  This translates  to over  400 grams  of CO2e per mile once we account for \\nemissions  generated  through the extraction,  refining and shipment of oil.\\n\\nThe carbon impact of ICE vehicles  remains the same every  year  of use, but for EVs, it should improve  every  year\\n\\nBased on publicly available  sales and fleet data, we estimate that an average  vehicle in the U.S. is driven slightly \\nless than 12,000 miles per year for about 17 years  before it is scrapped. Furthermore,  as an ICE vehicle  ages, its \\nfuel efficiency  only remains stable if serviced  properly. On the other hand, electricity  generation  to charge EVs \\nhas become  “greener” over  time with the addition  of cleaner energy sources to the grid. Below,  we  show zero-\\nemission  electricity  generation  capacity (including nuclear) in the U.S. since 2015. Even without  factoring in any \\nchanges to federal  policy or an acceleration  of the adoption  of renewables  in the U.S. (which is likely), if current \\ntrends remain stable, emissions  generated  through EV charging should continue to decline over  time.\\n\\nU.S. Electricity  Grid Generation  Mix (assuming continuation of recent tends)\\n\\nAverage  U.S. vehicle  lifetime\\n\\n80%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n5 8\\n\\n1NEDC = New European Driving Cycle; WLPT = Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; EPA = U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\n22021-2040 Tesla estimate based on recent grid mix shifts.

Below  are the lifecycle \\nemissions  scenarios  we show,  and the assumptions  used in each of the charts on the following  pages:\\n\\nAverage  Premium ICE: The reference ICE vehicle is based on an average  of mid-size  premium sedans and mid-\\nsize premium crossover  SUVs, with a real-world  fuel economy  of 24.3 MPG.\\n\\nModel  3/Y* Personal  Use (Grid Charged): What emissions  per mile could be if a Model  3/Y were  principally \\ncharged at home  from the grid.\\n\\nModel  3/Y Ridesharing  Use (Grid Charged): What emissions  per mile could be if a Model  3/Y were  used for \\nridesharing over  one million miles  using cell chemistry  from Tesla  energy products, charged from the grid.\\n\\nModel  3/Y Personal  Use (Solar  Charged): What emissions  per mile could be if a Model  3/Y were principally \\ncharged at home  using a solar system and energy storage.\\n\\nModel  3/Y Ridesharing  Use (Solar  Charged): What emissions  per mile could be if a Model 3/Y were used for \\nridesharing over  one million miles  using cell chemistry  from our energy products and if it were  only charged \\nusing a solar  system and energy storage.\\n\\nOther assumptions:\\n\\n• Charging a Model  3/Y using solar panels and a Powerwall  adds emissions  to the manufacturing phase while \\n\\nreducing use-phase emissions  to as low  as zero when 100%  of charging is done using that system.\\n\\n• We conservatively  assume no additional  renewable energy capacity on the grid during the life of the vehicle \\n\\ngiven the shape of the renewable energy adoption  curve is still very much up for debate.\\n\\n• Manufacturing phase emissions  for Model  3/Y in the U.S. represent a Fremont-made  vehicle, while \\n\\nmanufacturing phase emissions  in Europe and China represent a China-made  vehicle.\\n\\n5 9\\n\\n* This year we have added the impact of Model Y to the emissions  per mile calculation in our LCA.  Given that Model 3 and Model Y have 70%+ \\nparts commonality and share many manufacturing processes their GHG footprints are very similar. We have decided to present the LCA as a \\nweighted average of Model 3 and Model Y based on production share for each vehicle (for manufacturing phase emissions) and delivery volumes \\nin each region (for use-phase  emissions).\\n\\n\\x0cEV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile\\nUnited States\\n\\nThe electricity  grid keeps  getting cleaner, while emissions  from ICE vehicles  do not\\n\\nTo  put this in perspective,  average  GHG emissions  from charging one New York-based Tesla  vehicle  equates to \\nthe emissions  from an ICE vehicle  with a fuel economy  of 109 MPG (no such vehicle is on the market). Even \\nwhen charging a Tesla  in Michigan, where approximately  60%  of energy comes from natural gas and coal, the \\nemissions  from our vehicles  still equates to the emissions  from an ICE vehicle with 52 real-world  MPG \\n(considerably  more in terms of EPA rated MPG). As more regions adopt sustainable  energy solutions  to \\ngenerate  power,  emissions  related to charging an EV from the grid will decrease even  further.\\n\\nEV customers can increase their renewable energy mix by installing solar panels or a Solar Roof  and an energy \\nstorage  solution,  such as Powerwall,  in their homes. This dramatically  reduces the lifetime  carbon footprint  of an \\nEV, even  when accounting for the carbon footprint  of both the solar  panel/Solar  Roof  and Powerwall \\nmanufacturing and upstream supply chain.\\n\\nAverage  Lifecycle Emissions  in U.S. (gCO2e/mi)*\\n\\nAverage  Lifecycle Emissions in New  York State (gCO2e/mi)*\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nShift to \\ngreener \\ngrid\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n6 0\\n\\n*gCO2e/mi = grams of CO2-equivalent per mile driven\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n\\x0cEV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile\\nEuropean Union, U.K. & EFTA\\n\\nA cleaner grid in Europe means a bigger emissions  gap between  Model  3 and a comparable  ICE vehicle\\n\\nIn Europe, the U.K. and EFTA  (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland),  larger portions  of energy \\ngeneration  come from  either renewable sources or nuclear, which means that in Europe the use-phase emissions \\ngap between  ICEs and EVs is even  wider than it is in the U.S.\\n\\nOn the other  hand, since an average European driver  covers  fewer  miles per year than a U.S. driver,  emissions \\nfrom the manufacturing phase are divided by fewer  miles. While in the U.S., an average  vehicle covers  200,000 \\nmiles before  getting scrapped, in Europe, total mileage is closer to 150,000 miles.\\n\\nWe used Austria as an example  of how use-phase  emissions  should evolve  once the European grid becomes \\ngreener. As seen in the chart on the right, in Austria, all-in lifecycle  emissions  of a personal,  grid-charged Model \\n3Y are over  3.5x lower  than all-in lifecycle  emissions  of an equivalent  ICE vehicle.\\n\\nAverage  Lifecycle Emissions  in Europe (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions  in Austria (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nShift to \\ngreener \\ngrid\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n6 1\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n\\x0cEV vs. ICE Vehicle Emissions per Mile\\nChina\\n\\nDespite  a higher-emissions  grid in China, Model  3 still has lower  emissions  than comparable  ICE vehicles\\n\\nIn China, much of the grid is powered  by coal. That said, even  in this scenario, charging a Tesla  Model  3Y from \\nthe grid is still less emission  intensive  than running an ICE vehicle. Just like in Europe, we have assumed a \\nvehicle  lifetime  of 150,000 miles.\\n\\nWe are expecting the grid mix in China to improve  dramatically  over  time as China remains a dominant  deployer \\nand manufacturer of renewable energy. Sichuan Province (with a population  of 81 million) is a great example of \\nthis. In this province, given the high percentage of renewable energy penetration,  charging an EV from the grid \\nis less polluting  than charging an EV in most  global countries or states.\\n\\nIn conclusion, even as of 2021, charging a Tesla  Model 3Y in any of our major  markets is more environmentally \\nfriendly  than burning gasoline. Considering  that vehicles  are used for  17 to 20 years before  getting scrapped, it \\nis reasonable  to assume that in the coming years,  the gap in emissions  per mile between  EVs and ICEs will only \\nget wider.\\n\\nAverage  Lifecycle Emissions  in China (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\nAverage Lifecycle Emissions  in Sichuan Province (gCO2e/mi)\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nShift to \\ngreener \\ngrid\\n\\n500\\n\\n400\\n\\n300\\n\\n200\\n\\n100\\n\\n0\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n6 2\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nRidesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3Y\\nPersonal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAverage\\nPremium ICE\\n\\nManufacturing Phase\\n\\nUse Phase\\n\\n\\x0cReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nImproving Powertrain Efficiency\\n\\nMore efficiency  than a Prius, performance  of a Porsche\\n\\nTesla  vehicles  are among the most efficient  EVs built to date. In the early  days of Model  S production, we were \\nable to achieve  energy efficiency  of 3.1 EPA miles / kWh. Model  Y All-Wheel  Drive  (AWD)  achieves 4.1 EPA miles \\n/ kWh, which makes it the most efficient  electric  SUV produced to date. The gap between  Tesla  AWD  vehicle \\nefficiency  continues to stand out compared to competitors  in the same segment. While  achieving the best-in-\\nclass energy efficiency,  our AWD  models  can accelerate to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds (4.8s for Model  Y) and \\nreach a top speed  of 145 mph (135 mph for  Model Y). In isolation,  high energy efficiency  is already difficult  to \\nachieve,  but getting both performance  and efficiency  is the tricky part.\\n\\nTesla Robotaxis will be even  more energy efficient\\n\\nThe energy efficiency  of Tesla  vehicles  will continue to improve  as we improve  our technology  and powertrain \\nefficiency.  It is also  reasonable to assume that our high-mileage  products, such as our future Tesla  Robotaxis, \\nwill be designed  for maximum energy efficiency  as handling, acceleration  and top speed become less relevant. \\nThis will minimize  cost for our customers as well as reduce the carbon footprint  per mile driven.\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency — EPA range in miles/kWh\\nSmall SUVs (AWD)\\n\\nEnergy Efficiency — EPA range in miles/kWh\\nMid-Sized  Sedans (AWD)\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n6 3\\n\\nModel Y\\n\\nVW\\nID.4\\n\\nFord\\nMach E\\n\\nJaguar\\niPace\\n\\nAudi\\ne-tron\\n\\nModel 3\\n\\nPolestar 2\\n\\nBMW\\ni4 M50\\n\\nAudi e-tron\\nSportsback\\n\\nSource: OEM websites and other publicly available sources\\n\\n\\x0cReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nCurrent Actions\\n\\n1.  Building new, better designed  and more efficient  factories\\n\\nBuilding a factory from the ground up with sustainability  in mind can have a material impact on reducing energy \\nuse. For each component that requires less movement  around the factory, and as we  use fewer  robots  in the \\nvehicle  production process, energy consumption  declines.\\n\\nIn our quest for constant improvement,  we build each new factory to be better and more sustainable than the \\nprevious  one. For example, at Gigafactory  Texas,  we chose highly efficient, insulated, low  emissivity  windows  to \\nreduce building heating and cooling demand. In addition, waste heat recovery  from our compressors  alone  will \\noffset  over 1 MW of natural gas consumption  for process heating. While  we have already completed  substantial \\nimprovements  at Gigafactory  Shanghai, further improvements  will continue at Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg \\nand Gigafactory  Texas.\\n\\nModel 3 in Fremont, CA\\n\\nModel 3 in Gigafactory Shanghai\\n\\nkWh of Energy per Vehicle Produced\\n\\n6 4\\n\\nFremont\\n\\nShanghai\\n\\n\\x0cReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nCurrent Actions\\n\\n2.  Covering  roof  space with solar panels\\n\\nAll our new factories  are designed to be covered  with solar  panels. As of the end of 2021, we  had installed  solar \\npanels with a capacity of 21,405 kW, with the vast majority  installed on the roofs  of Gigafactory  Nevada, \\nGigafactory  New  York and our manufacturing facilities  in California. We will continue to add more capacity to \\nthese and other facilities  as space allows and as is economically  feasible.\\n\\n3.  Leveraging  AI to make our factories  more efficient\\n\\nWe are leveraging  six years  of sensor  data from Gigafactory  Nevada  to train an artificial  intelligence (AI) \\nprogram  to safely  control 195 interconnected HVAC  units, accounting for 6MW  of total electrical  load. In its first \\nfull year of operation,  we have measured significant  load reduction compared to baseline  usage. For such \\ncomparison,  we look  at actual energy usage for the HVAC system for the two  modes under the same conditions \\n(operations  in the factory, time of year, external  temperature,  etc.). AI control is expected  to achieve  significant \\nenergy savings for Tesla  as it is scaled up to control a majority  share of HVAC equipment  at Gigafactory  Nevada \\nas well  as HVAC equipment  at other Gigafactories.\\n\\n6 5\\n\\n\\x0cReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nTesla Manufacturing Footprint: \\nUpcoming Plans\\n\\nWe will not be content until all our factories  are carbon neutral, and there are other  projects that we are \\nworking  on to further reduce emissions.  In order to reduce the cost of  our vehicles  and batteries, we  also need \\nto use less energy to produce them. Many of the projects  created to achieve this goal were showcased  at our \\nBattery Day presentation  in September  2020.\\n\\n4.  Transitioning  to in-house manufactured 4680 Tesla  cells, whose  production process can reduce energy \\nconsumption  by more than 70%\\n\\nAt Tesla’s  2020  Battery Day, we presented a novel  way that cells can be manufactured using a dry electrode \\nprocess. Current electrode  production processes involve  mixing liquids with cathode or anode powders  and \\nusing massive  machinery to coat and dry the electrode.  Since this process involves  large ovens,  today’s  cell \\nproduction consumes  a lot of energy. The new dry-electrode  process allows for  the direct transition  from a \\ncathode or anode powder  to an electrode  film, reducing energy consumption  in the overall  cell manufacturing \\nphase by more  than 70% based on our latest analysis.\\n\\n5.  Utilizing renewable  energy as much as possible  throughout all our operations\\n\\nWe plan to shift energy consumption  toward renewables  as quickly as possible throughout  our operations, \\nwhether it is at our factories,  sales, service  or delivery  locations  or through our Supercharger network. \\n\\n6 6\\n\\n\\x0cReducing Carbon Footprint Even Further\\nIncreasing Vehicle Utilization\\n\\nOur batteries  are designed to function for the entire life of the vehicle\\n\\nTesla’s  battery packs are designed  to outlast  the vehicle. We estimate that a vehicle gets scrapped after \\napproximately  200,000 miles of usage in the U.S. and roughly 150,000 miles  in Europe. Creating a battery  that \\ncould last for 1,000,000 miles (4,000 charging cycles) would  dramatically  reduce the emissions  per mile driven \\nfor high-mileage  vehicles  such as taxis, delivery  vans or trucks.\\n\\nProducing Robotaxis  is a core part of our mission. All vehicles  in the world  combined travel  trillions  of miles \\nevery  year.  A relatively  small number of vehicles,  such as taxis, delivery  vans, trucks and buses account for a \\ndisproportionate  amount  of vehicle miles and, as a result, a disproportionate  amount  of emissions.  A single \\nfuture Tesla  vehicle  with a million-mile  battery could be utilized over  five-times  more  than an average vehicle  in \\nthe U.S. After being fully optimized,  and even  once it is scrapped, a battery  can still be recycled  and its \\nmaterials  used in a brand-new  battery.\\n\\nTesla Model  S/X Battery Capacity Retention per Distance Traveled\\n\\nStandard Deviation\\n\\nRetention\\n\\n100%\\n\\n80%\\n\\n60%\\n\\n40%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n0%\\n\\n0\\n\\n6 7\\n\\nNote: Mileage is only one factor in battery capacity retention; battery age is also a major factor.

However,  in support of our mission,  we track and try to minimize  emissions  that result from \\nour full value  chain, including our supply chain, manufacturing processes as well  as our sales, service and \\ndelivery  activities.\\n\\nIn 2021, we began measuring our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions  considering the principles and guidance \\nof the GHG  Protocol. We used the operational  control approach methodology  – accounting for GHG emissions \\nfrom operations  under our control. For  detailed information  on the scope of our calculations, please see page \\n139-142  of this report.\\n\\nWhile our total Scope 1 and Scope  2 emissions  may increase on an absolute basis in the near term as we \\ncontinue to open new factories,  our goal is to reduce the emissions  intensity  from production as we  push the \\nboundaries  of sustainable manufacturing and improve  the efficiency  of our operations.

Most companies lack primary data as it relates to their supply chain, product use and so on. Therefore, \\nmost Scope 3 GHG emissions  reporting is done using lofty  assumptions as well as estimates from databases –\\nthis can lead to figures that are magnitudes off from the actual impact. Tesla  has begun to measure the two \\nlargest categories within our Scope 3 emissions: those from use of product and our supply chain.\\n\\nUse of product emissions\\n\\nSupply chain emissions\\n\\nTesla has access to primary data from our over  two million  vehicles on the road and our fleet of solar and \\nstorage products — we can calculate our emissions at a much higher level  of accuracy than most manufactures \\nand can therefore develop  emissions  reduction solutions  to match. This also means that we can calculate our use \\nof product emissions year on year — we do not have to estimate emissions  over the lifetime of the vehicle \\nbecause we have primary data.\\n\\nPrioritizing  our supply chain is crucial and we have a lot of work to do to incentivize suppliers to provide energy \\nand emissions data for us to report on. We have already started to identify which materials and processes in our \\nsupply chain are key emitters so we can prioritize  engagement and projects to address these emissions — see \\nthe Supply Chain section for more detail.\\n\\nThe good thing for us is that Tesla’s  high level  of vertical integration and our direct sourcing relationships mean \\nwe are positioned  to manage upstream emissions better than most.\\n\\n100% Renewable Supercharger network\\n\\nEfficiency of an ICE vehicle does not improve  throughout its lifetime. EVs will get cleaner over  their lifetime as \\nthe grid becomes greener. We will continue to look for ways to enable our customers to further reduce their \\nemissions  beyond our vehicles — through solar and storage products and software to help differentiate when the \\ngrid is greener and pulling more renewable energy like solar or wind.\\n\\nThe global Supercharger network  was 100% renewable in 2021, achieved through a combination of onsite \\nresources and annual renewable matching. Additionally,  all home charging in California  was 100% renewable \\nthrough annual renewable matching. Therefore, the only emissions  from the use of Tesla vehicles  were a result of \\nhome charging outside of California  and use of third-party charging networks.\\n\\n\\x0cNOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants\\n\\nPollution  from burning fossil  fuels leads to eight million  premature deaths globally  each year \\n\\nAccording to recently published research in Environmental Research by Harvard University,  in collaboration  with \\nthe University  of Birmingham, the University  of Leicester and University  College  London, air pollution  causes \\nover  eight million  premature deaths annually. That is double the previous  estimate  of deaths from  the negative \\neffects  of fine-particle  pollution  and would  account for one-in-five  premature deaths worldwide.  This is a major \\nadvantage of EVs that is often forgotten  about as the overall  EV debate tends to focus on greenhouse  gases. \\nEVs are not just about the future of our planet, but very  much about addressing preventable  deaths today.\\n\\nWhile air-quality  is often categorized  as a problem in developing  countries, Nitrogen  oxide (NOx) and other \\nPM2.5 particulates* cause significant  issues in developed  countries as well.  In Europe alone, almost  800,000 \\npeople  die prematurely  every  year  due to pollution-related  illnesses.  EVs not only reduce the world's  total \\ncarbon footprint,  but also help to reduce city pollution.\\n\\nFine Particulate Air Pollution in Europe (2022)\\n\\n7 0\\n\\n\\x0cTesla Semi\\nReducing Fleetwide Emissions\\n\\nSemi offers  an opportunity  to have an outsized  impact on GHG emissions  from  transport\\n\\nCombination  trucks – of which the vast majority  are semi trucks – in the U.S. account for just 1.1%  of the total \\nfleet  of vehicles on the road. That said, because combination  trucks have high fuel consumption due to their \\nweight  and heavy utilization,  they account for approximately  18%  of all U.S. vehicle  emissions.  Electrifying  the \\nheavy-duty truck segment is an essential  part of transitioning  the world  to sustainable energy.\\n\\nPayload equal to a diesel truck\\n\\nWith both the U.S. and E.U. having approved  higher weight  allowances  for electric heavy-duty trucks, we expect \\nthe payload  to be at least as high as it would  be for a diesel  truck. In the E.U., electric semi trucks are allowed  to \\nbe 2 tons (~4,400 pounds) heavier than diesel  equivalents,  and in the U.S. the allowance  is 0.9 tons (2,000 \\npounds). When fully loaded, the Tesla  Semi should be able to achieve  over  500 miles of range, achieved  through \\naerodynamics  and highly efficient  motors.  This truck will be able to reach an efficiency  of over  0.5 miles  per \\nkWh.\\n\\nTesla Semi is critical to our mission to accelerate the world’s \\ntransition to sustainable energy. Right now, cell availability is \\nthe limiting  factor for production – a Tesla Semi requires \\nmultiple times more cells than a passenger vehicle. \\n\\nWhile most  heavy trucking journeys  are shorter  than 500 miles, we want long-distance  hauling to also be \\nsustainable. We are in the process of developing  a Semi charger network  at trucking rest stops across the U.S. \\nand Europe, where each Tesla  Semi could top up their range.\\n\\n% of U.S. Vehicle Fleet\\n\\n% of U.S. Vehicle Emissions\\n\\n1.1%\\n\\n17.9%\\n\\n7 1\\n\\nCombination Trucks\\n\\nRest of Fleet\\n\\nCombination Trucks\\n\\nRest of Fleet\\n\\n98.9%\\n\\n82.1%\\n\\n\\x0cWaste Generated Per Vehicle Manufactured\\n\\nAs we build more  efficient  factories, our waste per vehicle decreases\\n\\nBuilding localized  factories both makes  sense economically  and reduces waste. First,  because the automotive \\nsupply chain doesn’t have a strong presence on the West Coast of the U.S., many components  need to be \\nshipped from long distances, requiring excessive  packaging and creating more waste than necessary.\\n\\nSecond, modern factories  are better designed  for material flow.  Trailer  entry points surround the whole  factory, \\nwhich means that components  can be offloaded  precisely at the part of the factory where they are needed. Less \\nmaterial flow  results in less waste, because a shorter journey  requires less protective  packaging. The chart \\nbelow  shows  that waste generation  per vehicle  at Gigafactory  Shanghai is less than half of what it is in the U.S. \\nWe are expecting our upcoming factories  such as Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg  and Gigafactory  Texas  to \\ncontinue the same trend.\\n\\nAny materials that are possible to recycle, we recycle\\n\\nThe vast majority  of generated  waste, such as paper, plastics and metals, is recyclable. At Gigafactory  Shanghai, \\nfor example, just 7% of total waste generated  in 2021 was not recyclable.\\n\\nWe push for innovative  approaches to reducing waste, which includes reduction of non-recyclable  materials in \\nthe first place, learning from local  factories and deploying  improvements  globally  or working  with our logistics \\nteam to minimize  shipments  and packaging per vehicle.\\n\\nWaste Generated  in Vehicle Manufacturing (2021; kg/vehicle)\\n\\n600\\n\\n400\\n\\n200\\n\\n0\\n\\n7 2\\n\\nGigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\n• Legacy Manufacturing Sites = Gigafactory Nevada, Fremont Factory and supporting facilities.\\n• New Manufacturing Sites  = Gigafactory Shanghai.\\n\\n• Global Vehicle Manufacturing = all major factories dedicated to vehicle manufacturing, including  the Fremont Factory and supporting facilities, Gigafactory Nevada and \\n\\nGlobal Vehicle Manufacturing\\n\\nLegacy Manufacturing Sites\\n\\nNew Manufacturing Sites\\n\\nWaste Diverted from Disposal (Recycled)\\n\\nWaste Directed to Disposal\\n\\n\\x0cWater Used Per Vehicle Manufactured\\nCurrent State\\n\\nWe currently use less water per vehicle than almost  any ICE carmaker\\n\\nThere is a misconception  that producing an EV requires more water than producing an ICE vehicle. Our data \\nshows  this is not the case. While each automaker  may draw their boundaries  slightly differently  (depending  on \\nhow vertically  integrated they are), according to the latest publicly available  figures, Tesla  withdrew  less water \\nat facilities  dedicated to vehicle  manufacturing per vehicle  produced than the majority  of established \\ncarmakers.  Furthermore,  the efficient  manufacturing design we are implementing  at our new factories in Texas \\nand Berlin-Brandenburg  will result in further reductions  in our water usage per vehicle. Our goal is to have \\nindustry-leading  low water usage per vehicle, even  when accounting for cell manufacturing. The below  chart \\nincludes our latest estimates  for water usage per vehicle  at those facilities.\\n\\nWater  usage and power  generation\\n\\nWhile many recognize the impact that power  generation  has on GHG emissions,  its impact on water \\nconsumption  is less appreciated. Power  generation  is one of the leading causes of water withdrawal in the U.S., \\nas water for thermoelectric  power  is used to generate  electricity  with steam-driven  turbine generators and to \\ncool power-producing  equipment. This means that every  kilowatt-hour  (kWh) of clean solar energy produced \\nnot only lowers  GHG emissions,  but also lowers  water consumption.\\n\\nWater Withdrawal Intensity in Vehicle Manufacturing (m3/vehicle)\\n\\n5\\n\\n4\\n\\n3\\n\\n2\\n\\n1\\n\\n0\\n\\n7 3\\n\\n*Latest estimate for water consumption based on factory design.

That is why we are reducing our water usage \\nthroughout our operations  as much as possible. We have prioritized  direct use in manufacturing and will \\ncontinue to explore  the rest of our impact throughout the supply chain and in sales, service and delivery.\\n\\nThe “cooling tower  makeup”  is the single biggest contributor to water usage in any car factory after paint \\noperations.  As water that cools  machinery evaporates,  it needs to be topped up regularly. The total cooling \\ntower  makeup  could be offset  entirely by non-potable  sources such as rainwater or wastewater. These are some \\nof the initiatives  we are taking at Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg  and/or  Gigafactory  Texas in order to reduce \\nwater consumption  per complete vehicle  (including cells).\\n\\n1. Water  intensive process optimization:  We are constantly looking into reducing water consumption by \\noptimizing  or eliminating  water intensive  production  processes across our operations.  At Gigafactory  Berlin-\\nBrandenburg, we use hybrid cooling towers,  have eliminated  quench tanks in casting and introduced cascade \\nrinsing systems in the paint shop and battery can wash process for cell manufacturing.\\n\\n2. Rainwater and condensate harvesting and reuse: We are planning to capture at least 25% of roof runoff  (1 \\nmillion  square feet) to a central underground storage  system within Gigafactory  Texas.  Rainwater will be \\nrecycled for use in the cooling  of manufacturing equipment.  In an average  year, such systems should save an \\nestimated  7.5 million gallons  of potable  city water. Additionally,  as hot, humid outdoor  air is conditioned,  water \\ncondenses out of the air. Typically,  this condensate is discarded as wastewater. At Gigafactory  Texas,  we reuse \\nthis condensate in our cooling  towers  and process water systems to offset  incoming site water.\\n\\n3. Reclaimed and recycled water (wastewater reuse):  Using local treated wastewater could result in offsetting \\nthe entire annual cooling  tower  makeup water demand with non-drinkable uses. At Gigafactory  Texas,  this could \\nresult in an estimated 40 million  gallons  of potable city water conserved  annually. Reclaimed  water is available \\nand under investigation  for use at both Gigafactory  Texas  and Gigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg.\\n\\n7 4\\n\\n\\x0cEmissions Credits\\nAccelerating Deployment of New Factories\\n\\nEmissions  credit systems around the world  are designed to economically  benefit companies  with non-polluting \\nproducts by allowing  them to sell their credits to polluting  companies. In order to meet various  countries’ \\nemission  targets and avoid government  fines, polluting  companies pay non-polluting  companies  through credit \\npurchases. The goal of this system is for every  OEM to be incentivized  to reduce emissions  and themselves \\nbecome non-polluting  by selling more of their own manufactured EVs instead of paying another  company for \\ntheir non-polluting  credits. \\n\\nEmissions  credit revenue  is used for EV capacity expansion, which in turn displaces ICEs\\n\\nIn 2021, we generated  almost $1.5 billion in revenue selling zero-emission  regulatory credits to other OEMs. \\nProceeds from such sales will go towards building new factories to produce EVs that will continue to displace \\nICE vehicles. While  it is common  practice today for ICE vehicle  OEMs to purchase regulatory  credits from other \\ncompanies (such as Tesla)  to offset  their total  GHG emissions,  it is not a sustainable  strategy. In order to meet \\nincreasingly strict regulatory requirements  across the world,  OEMs will be forced to develop  truly competitive \\nEVs.\\n\\nEV sales by all carmakers  need to accelerate, taking market share from ICEs\\n\\nIn 2021, Tesla  delivered  almost 1 million  EVs globally. We hope that every  car manufacturer will strive  to produce \\nhundreds of thousands of EVs per year, as significant reduction  of emissions  will only be achieved  if all \\ncarmakers  push for an industry-wide shift to EVs.\\n\\nElectric Vehicles Produced \\n\\n1,000,000\\n\\n800,000\\n\\n600,000\\n\\n400,000\\n\\n200,000\\n\\n0\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\nToyota\\nMotor\\nCorp.\\n\\nJaguar\\nLand\\nRover\\n(Tata)\\n\\n7 5\\n\\nSource: EV-volumes.com; Micro-cars not included.

In order to \\nconvince consumers to buy our products, they need to be better in every  way – performance,  cost of ownership, \\nsafety, fun and more.

We are not just trying to build the \\nbest electric cars, we are striving to build the best cars, period. Our focus from the beginning has been to \\ndevelop  products that are not only sustainable, but also superior  to fossil-fuel  alternatives  in every  way.

While the “sticker price” of Model 3 is similar to \\nan equivalent BMW or Audi, the sticker price of a vehicle itself is only one of many cost items that need to be \\nconsidered. The lifetime running costs of EVs are lower  than those of ICE vehicles  due to lower  maintenance \\ncosts, cheap electricity and high residual value of used Tesla vehicles, the latter of which has remained \\nexceptionally  strong since our initial launch. As a result, Tesla Model  3 has a base price similar to BMW 3 Series, \\nbut the total cost of ownership per mile is closer to America’s  best-selling sedan, the Toyota  Camry*.\\n\\nCost data is based on data collected from our fleet\\n\\nThe advantage of having a fleet of vehicles that is constantly online is the ability to analyze real-world data \\nrather than only being able to use estimates.

Our data shows \\nthat Tesla  vehicles  are being driven  more than average  vehicles in the U.S., suggesting that they are generally \\nbeing used as a customer’s  primary vehicle. We fundamentally  believe  that you  shouldn’t have to choose \\nbetween  price, quality, usability  and sustainability.  An EV should be the best vehicle  in every  way, so consumers \\ndon’t ever  need to use ICE vehicles.\\n\\nThe longer the range, the higher the usage\\n\\nThere is a clear relationship  between  range, how  often an EV is utilized  and whether it is a primary-use  vehicle. \\nThe more confident owners  are that their EV can be used for commuting, errands  and long road trips, the less \\nthey will feel they  need to supplement  their EV with an ICE vehicle. Surveys  consistently indicate that the real or \\nperceived lack of EV range is the key  reason why many people  do not consider  replacing their ICE vehicle with \\nan EV.\\n\\nAverage  Annual Miles  Driven in the U.S.\\n\\nModel Y\\n\\nAvg.

To  ensure we replace as many ICE vehicles \\nwith EVs as possible, we have been focused  on increasing the range of Tesla  vehicles. While most personal \\nvehicle  journeys are relatively  short, and thus drivable  on a single charge, consumers  do not buy cars that can \\nmeet most of their driving needs; they  buy a car that meets alltheir driving needs.\\n\\nThe longer the range, the lower  the Supercharger use\\n\\nSince its introduction  in 2012, we have increased the range of the Model S by over  50%: from 265 miles to 405 \\nmiles of range for the long-range  version.  Our focus on energy efficiency — achieving  superior  range from the \\nsame size battery — has allowed  to us continue to increase range while keeping the battery size relatively \\nstable. Our data shows that the longer  the range of our vehicles, the less Supercharging Tesla  customers do. \\nAfter all, day trips of over  400 miles  are quite rare.\\n\\nSuper-fast  charging: V3 Superchargers can increase range by up to 200 miles in just 15 minutes\\n\\nAround 300 miles  of range at highway speeds  is equal to roughly four hours of driving. At that stage, drivers \\nare often likely  to take a break. We want to make sure that such a break can be relatively  short before \\ncontinuing the journey.  Our latest generation  of Superchargers can recover  up to 200 miles  of range in just 15 \\nminutes of charging, long enough for a quick break and snack.\\n\\nSubstantial coverage  and 99.96%  reliability\\n\\nWe’re aware that the chart showing  Supercharger uptime looks  silly, but that’s kind of the point. While  coverage \\nis important,  uptime is essential. Few  things are as frustrating as arriving to a charging station with a near-\\nempty battery,  realizing that none of the charging plugs are working. In 2021  alone, we opened 912  new \\nSupercharger locations  around the world  for a total of nearly 3,500 charging locations  with over  31,000 plugs. \\n\\nUptime of Supercharger Sites1\\n\\n100.0%\\n\\n99.5%\\n\\n99.0%\\n\\n8 0\\n\\n1Uptime of Supercharger sites reflects the average percentage of sites globally that had at least 50% daily capacity functional for the year.\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSafety  Is Our Top Design  Priority \\n\\nAt Tesla,  safety features are not optional.

Through our Tesla  Insurance program, we do just this \\nby providing real time feedback to customers  and incentives for safe driving such as reductions in monthly \\ninsurance premiums.\\n\\nCustomers  who choose  to be a part of this program  receive a Safety  ScoreBeta. This score changes based on \\ndriving behavior and the insurance premium changes with it. Instead of determining a driver’s  insurance \\npremiums from demographic  information  (gender, age, education, or marital status) and financial history (credit \\nscore), our algorithm  calculates Safety  ScoreBeta based on actual driver behavior.  The behaviors  we monitor  are: \\n\\n• Forward Collision  Warnings\\n\\n• Hard Braking\\n\\n• Aggressive  Turning\\n\\n• Unsafe Following  (Tailgating) \\n\\n• Forced Autopilot  Disengagement   \\n\\nOur data show  a lower  rate of collision  for the cohort of customers  who have enabled Safety  ScoreBeta.

We recently introduced active safety features that go beyond  the norm:\\n\\nTraffic  Light & Stop Sign Warning\\n\\nWhen a driver doesn’t  notice a red light or a stop sign, our cars will notice that vehicle’s  speed  is too high. \\nThanks to our eight-camera  system, each vehicle  can recognize a traffic  light that is specific to vehicle’s \\ntrajectory  as well as a stop sign.

However,  if you are in \\na Tesla,  when our cameras  recognize an object in front of the car, “Pedal Misapplication  Mitigation”  system cuts \\ntorque from the electric  motor  to prevent  a collision  if you  happen to press hard on the accelerator. This \\ntechnology  has prevented  or mitigated hundreds of collisions  every  month.\\n\\nActive  avoidance of  lane departure or a blind-spot  collision\\n\\nIf a driver  is changing into a lane while a vehicle  in the blind spot is entering the same lane, or if our vehicle \\nstarts departing its lane without  an indicator, our vehicles  will sound a warning and assist the steering to avoid a \\ncollision.\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\nCrash Avoidance\\n\\n8 3\\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nSafety Assist Ratings\\n\\nNot  all Active  Safety  systems are created equal\\n\\nMany people  assume that AEB (Automatic  Emergency Breaking) – a system that most new vehicles  are \\nequipped with – works  equally well  with all vehicles.  That’s not the case. The range of sensors, compute power \\nand quality of software  in the system can vary  dramatically.  Our active safety  features are powered  by eight \\ncameras,  a neural-net computer and learnings  from our fleet of over  two  million  cars. \\n\\nAfter the introduction of Tesla  Vision (a vision-only  system that excludes  radar), our active safety ratings with \\nIIHS improved.  Pedestrian AEB performance  of our Tesla  Vision was over  45% better  than performance  of vision \\n+ radar.\\n\\nIt is no surprise that the active safety  score achieved  by Tesla  Model  3 Euro NCAP  remains an outlier.\\n\\nEuro NCAP*\\n\\nANCAP* (Australasian New  Car Assessment Program)\\n\\nModel X\\n\\nModel 3\\n\\nModel Y\\n\\n94%\\n\\n94%\\n\\n94%\\n\\n94%\\n\\nScheduled for 2022\\n\\nScheduled for 2022\\n\\nIIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety)\\n\\nSuperior\\n\\nSuperior\\n\\nEuro NCAP  Safety Assist Rating (2019)\\n\\n100%\\n\\n95%\\n\\n90%\\n\\n85%\\n\\n80%\\n\\n75%\\n\\n70%\\n\\n8 4\\n\\n*2019 Safety Assist ratings\\n\\nTesla\\nModel 3\\n\\nCitroen\\nC5\\n\\nVW\\nT-Cross\\n\\nAudi\\nA1\\n\\nSEAT\\nTarraco\\n\\nSkoda\\nOctavia\\n\\nMercedes\\nGLE\\n\\nSubaru\\nForester\\n\\nVW\\nGolf\\n\\nLexus\\nUX\\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nAutopilot Safety\\n\\nTesla  vehicles  are engineered for safety  and when Autopilot  is engaged safety is enhanced\\n\\nIn 2021, we recorded 0.22 crashes for every  million  miles  driven in which drivers  were using Autopilot \\ntechnology  (Autosteer  and active safety  features). For drivers  who were not using Autopilot  technology  (no \\nAutosteer  and active safety  features), we recorded 0.77 crashes for every  million  miles driven.

Historically,  the aim of manufacturers has been to design their vehicles  to perform  well  for a \\nsuite of regulatory and consumer tests. There are too many common  impact scenarios (visible  in the heatmap \\nbelow)  that are simply  not covered by regulatory  crash tests. The richness of data we  are collecting enables us \\nto develop  safety  in all scenarios,  not only  the ones covered  by regulation and ratings. \\n\\nAlgorithm,  Trained  By Fleet,  Triggers  Optimal Safety  Responses\\n\\nWe analyze data from our fleet  to find solutions,  which we then update via over-the-air  software  updates. Our \\nalgorithm  uses vehicle sensor  data and, within tens of milli-seconds  of impact, determines  what type of impact \\nhas occurred and triggers  the seatbelt  pretensioners  and airbags to respond in the most  optimal way down  to \\nthe millimeter  and mile per hour. Tesla  engineers  are also in the final stages of evaluating  a system which uses \\nAutopilot  to identify  when a crash is imminent.  This gives  Tesla vehicles  an uncanny ability to predict potential \\ncollisions  and respond faster to an impact when it does occur.\\n\\nReal World Tesla  Crash Data\\n\\n \\n\\nd\\ne\\ne\\np\\ns\\n \\ne\\nv\\ni\\nt\\na\\ne\\nR\\n\\nl\\n\\nr\\na\\ne\\nr\\n \\n\\nm\\no\\nr\\nf\\n \\ne\\ng\\nn\\na\\nh\\nc\\n\\n0\\n\\nd\\ne\\ne\\np\\ns\\n \\ne\\nv\\ni\\nt\\na\\ne\\nR\\n\\nl\\n\\nt\\nn\\no\\nr\\nf\\n \\n\\nm\\no\\nr\\nf\\n \\ne\\ng\\nn\\na\\nh\\nc\\n\\n80 kmh rear impact (FMVSS305)\\n\\nSide \\nMDB\\n\\n20 mph 30° Angular\\n\\n25 mph 30° Angular\\n40 mph Small Overlap\\n\\n40 mph ODB\\n\\n35 mph\\nFlat\\nFrontal\\n\\nCollisions Recorded By Our Fleet\\n\\nRegulatory Collision Test\\n\\n8 6\\n\\nRelative speed change (impact) from right \\n\\n0\\n\\nRelative speed change (impact) from left \\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nData-Driven Safety\\n\\nChanging How Vehicles  Are Designed For  Safety\\n\\nWe use field data, data analytics and simulations  to inform our design and safety engineers’  work on future \\nproducts and to send software improvements  to our existing  fleet via over-the-air  updates. Tesla is also sharing \\ndata and statistics collected  by our vehicles  with select regulatory bodies  and external research organizations  —\\nin an anonymized  fashion or with consent and in accordance with local  data privacy laws — giving them access \\nto an unprecedented opportunity  to understand crashes in the real world.  This access to data will accelerate \\nimpact safety research, driving change across the safety industry and improved  safety  outcomes for all vehicles \\nto protect lives.\\n\\nPost-Crash  Data Analysis\\n\\nAfter we send new software to the fleet,  we wait for  new data to come through to understand the efficacy  of \\nthe system once it is deployed  in the real world.  Since deployment  of our ‘offzone’  side algorithm  (data-driven \\nsafety), we learned  that of the total vehicles  that had their airbags deployed,  15% of those deployed  due to our \\nnew algorithm  in these new modes.  This confirms  our expectations  and highlights how  effective  fleet-based \\nlearnings and rapid deployment  of novel  solutions  can be. \\n\\nWhy Airbags Sometimes  Don’t  Deploy\\n\\nIn a fairly common “small  overlap”  collision  as the one shown  below,  front sensors  are unlikely  to pick up a side \\ncollision,  as they are usually designed  to detect a frontal collision.  And side sensors  are usually too  close to a \\ndriver  window  to detect a collision  far in the front. We designed  our sensors  and their positions  in a way that \\nthey can pick up nearly every  type of collision  and deploy  airbags if necessary. \\n\\nRestraints Deployments  Since Introducing Data-Driven  Algorithm\\n\\nRegular restraint deployment\\n\\nRestraints deployment not covered by regulation\\n\\nWatch video  on Data-Driven  Safety\\n\\n8 7\\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nPassive Safety/Collision\\n\\nSafety  starts with our clean sheet design\\n\\nImproving  occupant safety has always been key to our mission. All our vehicles  are built off a safety-first \\narchitecture with a low  center of gravity (thanks to the positioning  of our battery) and enhanced frontal  impact \\nsafety (thanks to the front trunk that is void of the engine found in forward engine ICE vehicles).\\n\\nAdded  benefit of enhanced performance\\n\\nBased on the advanced architecture of Model  S and Model  X, we engineered  Model  3 and Model  Y to be some \\nof the safest  cars built to date, anywhere. Even though Model  3 and Model  Y have no engine, their performance \\nis similar  to a “mid-engine  internal combustion  car” due to a centered battery pack and the fact that the rear \\nmotor  is placed slightly in front of the rear axle rather  than behind it. Not  only does  this architecture add to the \\noverall  agility  and handling of the car, but it also improves  stability  control effectiveness  by minimizing \\nrotational  kinetic energy.\\n\\nModel  3 and Model  Y score 5-stars in all USNCAP  categories \\n\\nAfter putting Model  3 and Model  Y through a series of crash tests used as part of the New  Car Assessment \\nProgram  to calculate the likelihood  of serious  bodily  injury for front, side and rollover  crashes, the National \\nHighway Traffic  Safety  Administration  (NHTSA) awarded each top safety ratings  of 5-stars in every  category \\nand subcategory.\\n\\nTesla  has pioneered  the state-of-the-art  way of improving  a vehicle’s  safety  over  time\\n\\nA hallmark of Tesla ownership  is connectivity. We are an industry leader in deploying  over-the-air  (OTA) \\nsoftware  updates to our vehicles.  These updates are integral to – and continuously  enhance – the customer \\nexperience,  and they can include improvements  to customer  safety or a remedy to a recall. OTA updates can be \\ninstalled at a customer’s  convenience without  a trip to a Tesla Service  Center.\\n\\nOver-the-Air Updates\\n\\n8 8\\n\\n\\x0cVehicle Safety\\nSafety Awards\\n\\nSince 2019,  Tesla  vehicles earned 5-star ratings from safety  rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia.  Furthermore, all of Tesla’s  safety  features come standard \\nwith every  vehicle  and our ratings are based on our standard safety equipment.

This is likely a result of \\nchasing clicks, rather  than the prevalence  of EV-related fires compared to ICE vehicle-related  fires. The reality is, \\nwhen compared to Tesla  vehicles, ICE vehicles  catch fire at a vastly  higher rate. According to the latest available \\ndata, in 2020, there were  almost 173,000 vehicle fires in the U.S. alone.  \\n\\nFrom  2012 to 2021, there has been approximately  five Tesla  vehicle  fires for  every  billion miles  traveled.  By \\ncomparison,  data from the National  Fire Protection  Association  (NFPA)  and U.S. Department  of Transportation \\nshow  that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle  fires for every  billion  miles travelled.   \\n\\nIn order to provide  an apt comparison  to NFPA  data, Tesla’s  data set includes instances of vehicle  fires caused \\nby structure fires, arson and other  reasons unrelated to the vehicle, which account for  some of the Tesla vehicle \\nfires over  this time period.\\n\\nWe continue to improve  safety\\n\\nWe continue to improve  our battery chemistry,  cell structure, battery  pack structure and vehicle passive  safety \\nin order to decrease fire risk to as close to zero as possible.

If installing Megapack makes economic  sense, \\nthere is no reason not to install one. A single Megapack has on average  3,000 kWh worth  of battery storage \\ncapacity, and given its scalability,  enables projects  over  1,000,000 kWh. Tesla Energy continues to be \\ndependent on the global  supply chain, including cell supply. In 2021,  in order to meet  demand that is well  in \\nexcess of supply for energy storage  products, Tesla  began building a new production  facility capable of \\nproducing 40,000,000 kWh of energy storage per year.\\n\\nEnergy Storage  Enables 100% Renewables  Penetration\\n\\n120\\n\\n100\\n\\n80\\n\\nW\\nG\\n\\n60\\n\\n40\\n\\n20\\n\\n0\\n\\n9 1\\n\\nMonday\\n\\nTuesday\\n\\nWednesday\\n\\nThursday\\n\\nFriday\\n\\nSaturday\\n\\nSunday\\n\\n\\x0cSolar + Storage Product\\nPotential For Growth\\n\\nPairing energy storage  with renewables  enables cost-effective  decarbonization  of the grid\\n\\nThe best way to avoid blackouts is to reduce your  reliance on the grid. Tesla is a one-stop shop for taking our \\ncustomers  off-grid  by covering  a large variety  of their needs. In 2021, Tesla  sold 4 GWh worth of  energy storage \\nproducts, more than 15% of the 25 GWh global  market*. Some  of these projects were  massive  deployments, \\nincluding a 371  MWh installation  in California  and a 497 MWh installation  in Victoria, Australia.  In order to switch \\nglobal energy usage to renewable  sources, we  estimate that global  annual battery storage production  will need \\nto increase to ~10,000 GWh.\\n\\nResidential  customers:  Solar Roof,  solar panels and Powerwall\\n\\nAnyone  can dramatically  reduce their carbon footprint  by installing Solar  Roof or solar  panels with Powerwall. \\nIn theory,  all U.S. domestic  electricity  needs, as well  as vehicle transportation  needs, could be met by sunlight \\nalone. Naturally,  installation  of such a system needs to make financial sense for the customer.  In Massachusetts, \\nfor example, we estimate  that an average  solar and storage  system pays for itself  with energy cost savings \\nwithin approximately  10 years. As the cost of these products continues to decline, more customers  will be \\nwilling to switch to solar  and storage purely due to lower  overall  cost.\\n\\nTesla  Energy Storage  Deployments  (GWh)\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n3.5\\n\\n3.0\\n\\n2.5\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n1.5\\n\\n1.0\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n0.0\\n\\n9 2\\n\\n*Source: S&P Global\\n\\n2015\\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\x0cSolar + Storage Product\\nImproving Resilience Of The Grid\\n\\nGrid outages  are becoming more common\\n\\nElectrical disturbances in the U.S. are becoming more common,  predominantly  due to weather  and natural \\ndisasters.

Tesla  creates our products \\nfrom many different materials  and components,  some  of which we  purchase from our direct (Tier  1) suppliers. \\nMany of  our Tier  1 suppliers  do not purchase all their raw materials  directly, rather they  get them from their \\nsuppliers and sub-suppliers  around the world  through a complex supply chain. Though we believe  that battery \\nrecycling will play a critical role in supplying a portion  of these materials  to enable a closed  loop supply chain, \\nwe recognize that global battery cell production  will continue to rely heavily on primary,  mined materials to \\nmeet the growing demand for our products.\\n\\nIn line with our mission to accelerate the world’s  transition  to sustainable energy, Tesla  is committed  to ensuring \\nthat companies  in our supply chain respect human rights and protect the environment.  Our goal is that where \\nTesla’s  supply chain touches, local conditions  for stakeholders  continuously  improve  as a result of  our \\npurchases. Our responsible  sourcing strategy  has the following  objectives:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nIncrease the share of materials  we source directly  from suppliers, and those closer  to our factories \\n(supply chain localization);  and  \\n\\n2. Continue  to source globally,  to contribute to the improvement  of local conditions in our sourcing \\n\\ncommunities. \\n\\nMapping GHG emissions  in the battery supply chain is one of our top priorities\\n\\nUpstream GHG emissions  from  manufacturing an EV battery – from raw material extraction  through refining and \\ntransportation  of materials  – can be meaningful. We estimate that these specific activities  cause up to ~80% of \\nthe total emissions  of a Model  3 battery  pack, with the largest contributors  at the chemical processing stage. \\nOur battery supply chain GHG emissions hotspot  analysis – an industry first – is on page 104 of this report.\\n\\n~12 ton of rock mined\\n\\nRefined electrode material\\n\\nProduce a battery pack\\n\\nProduce a battery pack\\n\\nProduce a battery pack\\n\\nRefine\\n\\nRecycle\\n\\nRecycle\\n\\nRecycle\\n\\n9 5\\n\\n\\x0cA common question  we receive is: “What  happens to Tesla battery packs once they reach the end of their life?” \\nAn important  distinction between  fossil  fuels and lithium-ion  batteries as an energy source is that while fossil \\nfuels are extracted  and used once, the materials  in a lithium-ion  battery are recyclable. When petroleum  is \\npumped out of the ground, chemically  refined and then burned, it releases  toxic emissions  into the atmosphere \\nthat are not recoverable  for reuse. Battery materials, in contrast,  are refined and put into a cell and will remain in \\nthe cell at the end of their life when they can be recycled  to recover  valuable  materials for reuse, repeatedly.\\n\\nLonger battery longevity  is the most sustainable option\\n\\nBattery pack life extension  is the superior  option  to recycling for both environmental  and business reasons. \\nBefore  decommissioning  and recycling a consumer  battery pack, Tesla does  everything  it can to extend the \\nuseful life of each pack, including sending out over-the-air  software  updates to Tesla  vehicles  to improve  battery \\nefficiency  when our engineers  find new ways to do so. In addition,  any battery that is no longer meeting  a \\ncustomer’s  needs can be serviced at a Tesla  Service Center.\\n\\nEvery battery used in R&D or returned from the field that cannot be re-manufactured is recycled\\n\\nTesla  batteries, including the battery packs in our vehicles  and our energy storage  products, are made to last \\nmany years,  and therefore, we have received a limited number of them back from the field.  Most batteries  that \\nTesla  recycles today are pre-consumer, coming to us through R&D  and quality control. None of our scrapped \\nlithium-ion  batteries  go to landfills and 100%  are recycled. Furthermore,  Tesla has an established  internal \\necosystem to re-manufacture batteries coming from the field to our Service Centers. We actively  implement \\ncircular economy  principles and consider all other options  before  opting for battery recycling.\\n\\nThe small number of post-consumer  batteries  that we receive are primarily  generated  from our fleet of  vehicles \\non the road, predominantly  from taxi-like  vehicles.  Since we have only  been producing Model  S (our oldest \\nmodel)  for approximately  ten years,  and our energy storage  products for even less time, it will likely  be some \\ntime before  we start receiving back vehicle  batteries in larger volumes.\\n\\nSupply Chain \\nRecycling\\n\\nExtracting raw \\nmaterials\\n\\n9 6\\n\\n\\x0cSupply Chain \\nRecycling\\nGlobal annual amount of lithium-ion battery metals sent for \\nrecycling\\n\\n1,500\\n\\nTons of Nickel\\n\\n300\\n\\nTons of Copper\\n\\n200\\n\\nTons of Cobalt\\n\\nA closed-loop battery recycling process presents a \\ncompelling solution to move energy supply away from the \\nfossil-fuel based practice of take, make and burn, to a more \\ncircular model of recycling end-of-life batteries for reuse over \\nand over again.\\n\\nWhile Tesla  works  with third-party  recyclers, we also  recycle in-house\\n\\nIn 2020, Tesla  successfully installed the first phase of our cell recycling facility at Gigafactory  Nevada  for in-\\nhouse processing of both battery manufacturing scrap and end-of-life  batteries. While Tesla  has worked  for \\nyears  with third-party  battery recyclers to ensure our batteries  do not end up in a landfill, we  understand the \\nimportance  of also building recycling capacity in-house  to supplement  these relationships.  On-site recycling \\nbrings us one step closer  to closing the loop on materials generation,  allowing  for raw material transfer  straight \\nto our nickel and cobalt suppliers. The facility unlocks the cycle of innovation  for battery recycling at scale, \\nallowing  Tesla  to rapidly  improve  current designs through operational  learnings and to perform  process testing \\nof R&D products. By the end of 2021,  this facility achieved  a production  rate of over  50 tons of recycled  material \\nper week.\\n\\nEvery Tesla  battery factory will recycle batteries  on-site\\n\\nAs the manufacturer of our in-house cell program, we are best positioned  to recycle our products efficiently  to \\nmaximize  key battery  material recovery. With the implementation  of in-house cell manufacturing at Gigafactory \\nBerlin-Brandenburg  and Gigafactory  Texas, we expect substantial  increases in manufacturing scrap globally. We \\nintend to tailor recycling solutions  to each location  and thereby  re-introduce valuable materials  back into our \\nmanufacturing process. Our goal is to develop  a safe recycling process with high recovery  rates, low  costs and \\nlow  environmental  impact. From  an economic perspective,  we expect to recognize significant savings over  the \\nlong term as the costs associated with large-scale  battery material recovery  and recycling will be far lower  than \\npurchasing additional  raw materials  for cell manufacturing.\\n\\n9 7\\n\\n\\x0cSupply Chain \\nAlignment with Best Practices\\n\\nWe have high expectations  for our suppliers\\n\\nTesla  is committed  to ensuring that our suppliers  operate  responsibly. We do this by proactively  identifying  and \\naddressing potential risks in our supply chains. The Tesla  Supplier Code  of Conduct, Human Rights Policy and \\nResponsible  Materials  Policy outline  Tesla’s  expectations  for suppliers. \\n\\nWe established a responsible  sourcing program  based on international  best practices \\n\\nOur responsible  sourcing program  is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible  Mineral \\nSupply Chains. Tesla  collects data from its supply chain (including through audits), translates  this data into on-\\nthe-ground actions and discloses  the outcomes  in our annual Impact Report.\\n\\nDirect Sourcing from Upstream Companies \\n\\nEstablish \\nDue Diligence \\nManagement \\nSystem\\n\\nDisclosure  in the \\nImpact Report \\n\\nCollect  and \\ninvestigate Supply \\nChain Environmental \\nand Social Data\\n\\nCollaboration  with \\nIndustry Initiatives\\n\\nRisk Mitigation \\nand Improvement \\nof Conditions\\n\\nPositive  Local Impact \\n\\n9 8\\n\\nThe next sections  will detail how  we undertake each of the five steps laid out above,  starting with our \\nmanagement  system approach.\\n\\n\\x0cBattery Supply Chain\\n#1 The Tesla Approach\\n\\nPrioritization  of cobalt, lithium and nickel\\n\\nGiven  their unique significance to the success of EVs and energy storage,  Tesla has a dedicated responsible \\nsourcing program for three priority  minerals  in the battery supply chain: cobalt, nickel and lithium. We prioritize \\nthese raw materials for the following  reasons:\\n\\n1. Commercial  importance: Cobalt,  lithium and nickel are the key  raw materials used in cathode production, \\n\\nrepresent about a third of the total costs of a battery cell and play an essential function in improving  vehicle \\nrange and safety performance.\\n\\n2. Potential  environmental and social  impact and scrutiny: Cobalt,  lithium and nickel are also ‘minerals’  – in that \\n\\nthey are raw materials  that are produced through different methods  of mining around the world, often \\nconcentrated in countries  that face socio-economic  and environmental challenges.  As known  global reserves \\nare depleted, these  minerals  are becoming increasingly scarce, and companies look  to access resources in \\nmore remote  and challenging locations  to meet global  demand. Cobalt,  lithium and nickel are also classified \\nas critical minerals  by the United States, European Union and Canadian governments  because they  are \\nessential  in enabling a transition  away from fossil  fuels to a low-carbon  economy.  As a result, the impact of \\nmining activity on the environment  and local communities  lends itself  to greater environmental  and social \\nscrutiny from civil society,  policymakers  and investors.\\n\\nMining has an important  role to play in the transition  to sustainable energy and we engage with suppliers to \\nensure mining is done in a responsible  way. This is one of the reasons Tesla  joined the Initiative  for Responsible \\nMining Assurance (IRMA) and uses the IRMA  Standard as well  as other  internationally  recognized responsible \\nmining standards in our due diligence.\\n\\n9 9\\n\\n\\x0cBattery Supply Chain\\n#1 The Tesla Approach\\n\\nThe unique Tesla  approach: Going directly  to the source\\n\\nThe implementation  of an OECD-aligned  approach for cobalt, nickel and lithium is underpinned by the following \\ntwo  pillars:\\n\\n1. Direct sourcing from mining companies: While cobalt, nickel and lithium go through multiple  processing \\n\\nsteps by different  companies, some  of the more  important  environmental and social  risks in this supply chain \\nare present at mine sites. Direct sourcing from  mining companies  allows  Tesla to engage directly in local \\ncontexts instead of having to rely on multiple  midstream companies  that typically  sit between  EV makers \\nand mining. It also  enables more transparent  and traceable  supply chains and better environmental  and \\nsocial data. In 2021, Tesla  procured >95% of lithium hydroxide,  >50% of cobalt and >30% of nickel for nickel-\\ncontaining (NCA  and NCM) cells directly from nine mining and chemicals companies.

Tesla  will continue to advance a diversified  cathode strategy  for LFP, nickel-rich and \\nmanganese-rich  cathodes to address various  market  segments  for vehicle and energy storage  products and \\nprovide  future flexibility  based on raw materials  availability  and pricing. To  put this into context, lithium only \\naccounts for roughly 1.5% of the full battery pack weight.  Additionally,  iron phosphate battery packs contain no \\ncobalt or nickel. \\n\\nWhile the relative cathode  compositions  and our overall  demand of various  minerals  and battery-grade \\nchemicals will continue to evolve,  Tesla  and the global  battery supply chain will require significant quantities  of \\nresponsibly  produced lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, iron, phosphates and many other minerals  for the \\nforeseeable  future. While we recognize  the critical role battery recycling will play in supplying a portion  of these \\nmaterials  to enable a closed loop  supply chain, global cell production  will continue to rely heavily on primary, \\nmined materials to meet the growing demand in the short to medium  term. The availability  and affordability  of \\nthese minerals  and chemicals are key  to advancing Tesla’s  mission  and accelerating the transition  to sustainable \\nenergy. We will continue to collaborate  with our suppliers and upstream producers in providing visibility  to \\nenable the scale up of key  battery minerals.\\n\\nFor cells containing NCA  and NCM cathodes,  we continue to work  toward batteries that contain higher levels  of \\nnickel in order to improve  vehicle  range while lowering  overall  battery costs, without  compromising  overall  cell \\nperformance,  such as battery safety and lifetime,  that is currently enabled by cobalt. It is important  to note that \\nwe expect our absolute  cobalt demand to increase over  the coming years  because our vehicle  and cell \\nproduction growth  rate is forecasted to outpace the overall  rate of cobalt reduction on a per cell basis.\\n\\nNickel-Cobalt-Aluminum  Cathode\\n\\nNickel-Manganese-Cobalt  Cathode\\n\\nLithium-Iron-Phosphate Cathode\\n\\nP\\n\\n1 0 1\\n\\n\\x0cBattery Supply Chain\\n#2 Risk Identification\\n\\nCollect  and review  environmental  and social data to identify  risks\\n\\nIn the past year,  Tesla collected  environmental  and social  data in its cobalt, lithium and nickel supply chains \\nthrough the following  main activities:\\n\\n2.1 Audits\\n\\nAudits are an important  tool  for Tesla to gather environmental and social  data for cobalt, nickel and lithium. \\n\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2021, 83% of refiners and mine sites in Tesla’s  supply chain, including 100%  of refiners  and mine sites from \\nwhom Tesla  sources directly, either underwent  or committed  to undergo independent external  sustainability \\naudits against one of the following  sustainability  and responsible  mining standards: IRMA Standard, the \\nResponsible  Minerals  Initiative (RMI) Responsible  Minerals  Assurance  Process (RMAP), Towards  Sustainable \\nMining (TSM) and/or the International Council  on Mining and Metals  (ICMM) Performance  Expectations.\\nIn addition, Tesla  conducted six audits in the battery supply chain tailored  to Tesla’s  specific environmental \\nand social requirements,  including the OECD  guidance and environmental  management systems.

Yet, the program  has achieved  several \\nimportant  milestones  this last year,  including the development  and initial implementation  of a system to identify \\nenvironmental  and social risks in the battery supply chain and concrete progress towards mitigation  and \\nimproving  the situation  of stakeholders  impacted by Tesla’s  battery supply chain.\\n\\nIn 2022, Tesla  plans to continue building on momentum  of the program and improve  on the data points shared \\nin this report, including the development  of supply chain GHG emissions reduction plans and further projects \\nand investments  in mining countries to have a positive  environmental  and social impact. Tesla  will then explore \\nan expansion  to manganese, graphite, copper and mica. \\n\\n1 1 1\\n\\n\\x0cResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Program\\n\\nTesla’s  Supplier  Audit program\\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla  initiated its Supplier  Audit program  with the objective  to extend our supplier performance \\nevaluation  to key  environmental  and social  impact metrics relevant  to Tesla’s  business. This program  extension \\nwas introduced at the time  when Tesla  was transitioning  from a small automotive  manufacturer to a company \\ngaining recognition  as the leader in electrical  vehicle production. We recognized  that this growth  came with an \\nincreased ability to impact positive  change on the practices  of our suppliers,  but also with an increased \\nresponsibility  to drive  such change in line with our mission  statement. During the program  pilot phase, we \\nfocused our efforts  on suppliers that we deemed high risk based on their industry or the use of potentially \\ndangerous processes and/or  chemicals in the manufacturing of our parts.\\n\\nWe chose to utilize  the Responsible  Business Alliance’s (RBA) Validated Assessment  Program (VAP) as the \\nbasis for our audits. The RBA’s VAP is an audit protocol  globally  recognized for its breadth of topics and \\nstringent requirements  for supplier completion.  It covers  nearly 200 checkpoints  across labor, health and safety, \\nenvironmental,  ethical and management system topics. Audits are conducted by independent third parties that \\nare approved  by the RBA, and all auditors must undergo training by the RBA on the audit standard and its \\nimplementation  ensuring a globally  and industry-wide  standardized approach.\\n\\nIn any case where any priority  non-conformance  (the most significant type)  occurs, our audit procedures \\nrequire that suppliers undergo a closure audit. These closure audits – which are a follow  up to the original  audit \\nwhere the non-conformances  were identified  – allow  suppliers to address all non-conformances  in the earlier \\naudits. Additional  audits, rather than an immediate  suspension  of the business relationship,  are preferred to \\nimprove  working  conditions  and reduce the risk of continued deficiencies.\\n\\nAs of the end of 2021, we had a total of 152 supplier locations  go through our supplier audit at least once, \\nrepresenting 144 suppliers, or 10%  of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. As part of these audits over  4,000 \\nsupplier employee  interviews  were conducted.\\n\\n1 1 2\\n\\n\\x0cResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Expansion\\n\\nContinuing  to expand our audit program\\n\\nIn 2021, Tesla  redefined its criteria for determining  which of our suppliers are subject to the Supplier  Audit \\nprogram. While in its initial stages the suppliers subject to the audit were mainly located in China, and the \\nupdated criteria expanded  the scope to include significantly  more suppliers  globally. When we  started our audit \\nprogram,  we had only just announced our plans for Gigafactory  Shanghai. We now have six factories  across \\nthree different continents, and our production volume  of  vehicles has grown  exponentially.  As our global \\nfootprint  and manufacturing grew, so did our supply base. Therefore, the expansion  of our audit program  was \\nan important  step to ensure that our supplier due diligence efforts  continue to reflect  the realities  of our supply \\nchain and can properly identify  and address potential risks within our supply base.\\n\\nThe criteria on which suppliers  are selected to undergo the Supplier  Audit is based on an expanded risk \\nassessment  approach, looking  at Tesla’s  exposure  to suppliers financially,  as well as suppliers’ location.  This \\ncriteria determines  which suppliers  are obligated  to undergo an audit, but additional  suppliers can be \\nnominated by our commercial  and supplier  industrialization  teams where they  see value in doing so or the \\npotential  to further mitigate  risk. With the expanded  audit program  scope, we are targeting to cover  over  50% \\nof our global spend with our direct supply base.\\n\\nAs part of our program  expansion,  we are building on our ability to influence supplier  behavior in a positive \\nway. When a supplier is not meeting  our expectations,  they are obligated  to implement  corrective action plans \\nto remedy any deficiencies  or non-conformances  found during the audit process, regardless of the severity.  In \\ncases of the highest priority  non-conformances,  suppliers are required to undergo closure audits to ensure that \\ntheir corrective  action plans have been fully implemented.  In cases of less severe  non-conformances,  suppliers \\nare still required to develop  and implement  corrective  action plans as well  as provide  evidence  to Tesla  that \\nthose plans have been fully implemented  within our expected timelines.\\n\\nFurthermore,  we defined a separate  category called Zero  Tolerance  Violations, which, for example, include any \\nviolations  related to the use of forced or child labor  and inhumane treatment  of workers.  In cases where such \\ninstances are discovered,  our supply chain leadership  will be informed,  and a corrective  action plan will be \\ndeveloped  immediately,  together  with the supplier. Tesla  will transition  away from  the supplier relationship  if the \\nsupplier is unable or unwilling to correct the identified  issues and improve  their operations  within a reasonable \\ntime frame.\\n\\n1 1 3\\n\\n\\x0cResponsible Sourcing\\nIdentifying Priorities\\n\\nHow  we identify and prioritize  risks in our supply chain\\n\\nOur Supplier  Audit program  is an important  part of our efforts  to identify  and address environmental  and social \\nrisks within our supply chain. These audits allow  for a snapshot of a supplier facility’s  programs  and procedures, \\nbut also sets a baseline  for future evaluations.  Additionally,  Tesla utilizes  other avenues to evaluate  potential \\nrisks in our supply chain such as those  detailed below.\\n\\nWe engaged with several  third-party  service providers  allowing  us to continually monitor  our supply chain for \\nemerging issues that may affect our suppliers.  These include issues related to labor relations, human rights and \\nenvironmental  degradation.  This monitoring  allows  our Global Supply Managers  to be notified  as soon as \\ninformation  about suppliers becomes  public and act by engaging directly  with the supplier to understand their \\nplans for correcting the identified  risk.\\n\\nTesla  follows  the OECD Due Diligence  Guidance for Responsible  Business Conduct when identifying  risks within \\nour supply chain. We require suppliers to cooperate  with our efforts  and assist in identifying  and removing \\npractices within our supply chain that are contradictory  to our policies.  Our responsible  sourcing policies \\nrequire suppliers  to provide  requested information  regarding potential  violations  of our policies.  Furthermore, \\nwe continue to leverage  our membership  with the RBA to identify  upcoming supply chain risks as well  as \\nunderstand industry best practices to address them. We are actively  involved  with the RMI as well  as specific \\naction groups within the organization.  In addition, we have utilized many of the RBA tools, such as country risk \\nanalysis to understand inherent risks in our supply chain and RBA-Online  to collect information  on corporate \\nand factory-specific  supplier  performance.\\n\\n1 1 4\\n\\n\\x0cResponsible Sourcing\\nSupplier Audit Findings\\n\\nAcross  all audits, we found no instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment  of workers\\n\\nThe table below  details findings of our audits across all suppliers  regardless of severity  and includes initial \\naudits as well as closure audits. Through July 2021, our suppliers have addressed and remedied 100%  of priority \\nnon-conformances,  with the remaining open priority  findings to be addressed in upcoming closure audits. Our \\ninitial focus on high-risk suppliers  allowed  us to cover  more than 70% of this group in the first three years  of the \\naudit program  and gave us an understanding of suppliers  to prioritize  in an expanded program. \\n\\nIn all audits conducted at Tesla's  request at supplier manufacturing facilities producing Tesla products, we found \\nno instances of child labor, forced labor or inhumane treatment.\\n\\nSupplier Audit Findings (2018-2021)\\n\\nAudits Conducted\\n\\nAverage Non-Conformance per Audit\\n\\nLabor\\n\\nHealth & Safety\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nManagement Systems\\n\\nEthics\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n2018\\n\\n12\\n\\n28\\n\\n30%\\n\\n30%\\n\\n14%\\n\\n6%\\n\\n20%\\n\\n100%\\n\\nBreakdown of Findings by Topic (%)\\n\\n2019\\n\\n108\\n\\n21\\n\\n30%\\n\\n27%\\n\\n14%\\n\\n4%\\n\\n25%\\n\\n100%\\n\\n20201\\n\\n81\\n\\n16\\n\\n31%\\n\\n30%\\n\\n13%\\n\\n2%\\n\\n24%\\n\\n100%\\n\\n20211\\n\\n41\\n\\n15\\n\\n37%\\n\\n33%\\n\\n14%\\n\\n1%\\n\\n15%\\n\\n100%\\n\\nIn 2021, the five most common findings were related to (% of total findings within each category)2:\\n1.

We emphasize  structuring \\ncompensation  to reward our named executive officers  based on performance, and equity awards weigh heavily in \\nour named executive officers’ total compensation,  including awards that vest upon the achievement  of clear and \\nmeasurable milestones. \\n\\nTesla builds products with privacy and security at their core. Additionally,  managing data privacy is a shared task \\nthrough all levels  of our organization.  Our privacy principles are: 1. We build privacy into our products from start \\nto finish; 2. We give customers choices about their data; 3. We maintain trust through transparency; and 4. We \\nsafeguard personal data.\\n\\nThe ethical treatment  of all people  and regard for human rights is core to our mission  of a sustainable future. We \\nbelieve  all businesses  within our supply chain have a responsibility  to share our respect  for human rights. Our \\nhuman rights policy is the formalization  of our commitment  to uphold and respect  these rights and the values \\nthey represent. We have a zero-tolerance  policy when it comes to child or forced  labor and human trafficking  by \\nour suppliers.\\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\n11 - 12\\n\\n13\\n\\n16\\n\\n17 - 18\\n\\n19 - 20\\n\\n1 1 7\\n\\n\\x0cSummary – People and Culture\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nTopic\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nAttracting Employees\\n\\nCompensating  Employees\\n\\nRetaining Employees\\n\\nDiversity,  Equity and Inclusion\\n\\nRespectful Workplace\\n\\nEmployee  Engagement\\n\\nDisaster Relief\\n\\n1 1 8\\n\\nTesla's employees  are its greatest asset and critical to achieving our mission. Our People  Strategy is centered on \\nproviding meaningful work, a respectful, safe, inclusive and equitable workplace, compensating our people  well, \\nand making our benefits an outlier.\\n\\nOur employee  count has grown ~70 fold over the past decade and, in just over  ten years,  created nearly 100,000 \\ndirect jobs. Whether  it is through our direct hiring opportunities,  internships or workforce  development \\nprograms,  interest  in joining Tesla’s mission  is at an all-time  high. We  had more than 3,000,000 unique \\napplicants globally  in 2021  alone.\\n\\nTesla provides  a highly competitive  wage that meets  or exceeds the wages  of comparable  manufacturing roles, \\neven before  equity and benefits  are factored  in, and we want our benefits  to be an outlier  in the manufacturing \\nindustry. We have an annual pay equity program  in place, designed  to assess  whether similarly  situated \\nemployees  are paid in a similar  manner after  accounting for  a range of variables. \\n\\nAs Model 3 has become the best-selling  premium sedan globally and our profitability  (operating margin) has rose \\nto the highest in the industry, employee  satisfaction has improved.  This has fueled our ability to expand \\ndramatically  and provide  career opportunities  for many strong performers.  As nearly 70%  of our leadership  is \\npromoted  from within Tesla,  our employees  are surrounded  by examples  of successful progression. \\n\\nWe are proud to be a majority-minority  company with a large representation  of employees  from  communities \\nthat have long struggled to break through the historic roadblocks  to equal opportunity  in the U.S. As of \\nDecember  31, 2020,  34% of our directors  and vice presidents  are people  of color. This year we published our \\nlatest EEO-1 data for  the first time.\\n\\nWe strive  to create an environment  where people  love  to come  to work every day. With over 100,000 \\nemployees  as of March 2022,  challenges arise, and we address them head on. In 2021,  we re-doubled  our efforts \\nto educate employees  and managers that any form of discrimination  must be reported. \\n\\nEmployee  engagement drives  productivity,  satisfaction  and loyalty  and plays a critical role  in employee \\nretention.  Tesla’s  engagement initiatives  strive  to make employees  feel informed,  valued and respected,  while \\ncompany-wide  open-door  policies  with leaders  empower  employees  to make their ideas heard. \\n\\nWe are committed  to providing  disaster relief  through product donations.  Our disaster  relief  efforts  have \\nprovided  100%  clean, emissions  free  emergency  power to people  in Ukraine, New Orleans after Hurricane Ida, \\nand Kentucky and Texas after sever winter  storms. We also provided  free supercharging to customers  in \\ncountries  surrounding Ukraine. \\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\n22\\n\\n23 - 27\\n\\n28 - 32\\n\\n33 - 34\\n\\n35 - 41\\n\\n42 - 43\\n\\n44\\n\\n45 - 46\\n\\n47 - 54\\n\\nEnvironmental, Health, Safety  and \\nSecurity\\n\\nIn 2021, our focus remained  on protecting  people,  the planet, our property  and products. We recently  deployed \\nour new EHS&S  system  – MyEHS – in order to better  collect and manage data, allowing  us to make decision that \\nreduce risk. Furthermore,  in 2021,  our ATSM  Global  Serious  Injury Rate remained  below the industry average.\\n\\n\\x0cSummary – Environmental Impact\\n\\nTopic\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nLifecycle Analysis of Tesla Vehicles \\nversus Average ICE\\n\\nRegardless of where they are driven (U.S., Europe or China), a Model  3 and Model Y emit far fewer greenhouse \\ngas emissions  per mile than a comparable  ICE. Moving the grid toward  more renewables and making our \\noperations  and supply chain less GHG intensive will only make this dynamic more  pronounced as time goes on.\\n\\nGHG Emissions: Scope 1, 2, 3\\n\\nNOx, Particulates and Other Pollutants\\n\\nWe have disclosed our full Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based)  emissions  this year. We have also disclosed the \\namount of CO2e  emitted through the use of our vehicles (part of Scope 3). The global Supercharger network  and \\nhome charging in California  were both 100% renewable  in 2021,  achieved through a combination  of onsite \\nresources (for the Supercharger network only) and annual renewable  matching. \\n\\nNew research shows that fossil fuels are alone responsible  for more than 8 million premature  deaths annually, or \\nalmost one out of every five deaths globally, double previous estimates. Zero  tailpipe emissions  is a commonly \\noverlooked  benefit of EVs.\\n\\nTesla Semi's Impact on Emissions\\n\\nTesla Semi is poised to make a large impact: in the U.S., combination trucks make up just 1.1% of the vehicle fleet \\nbut account for 17.9%  of annual emissions.\\n\\nWaste Generated  per Vehicle \\nManufactured\\n\\nAs we continue to build new, more  efficient factories  our ability to limit packaging and reduce waste increases. \\nWaste generated per vehicle in Shanghai production is 60%  less than our manufacturing in the U.S. We continue \\nto push for innovative  approaches to reducing waste as we expand our global operations.\\n\\nWater Used per Vehicle Manufactured\\n\\nWater use per vehicle produced by Tesla was again below  the industry average in 2021. Our new factories such as \\nGigafactory  Berlin-Brandenburg will set a new standard when it comes to low water use per vehicle.\\n\\n73 - 74\\n\\nEmissions Credits\\n\\nIn 2021,  Tesla delivered more than 2x as many EVs as our next closest  competitor,  helping drive $1.5bn in revenue \\nfrom selling regulatory  credits. This money is being used to accelerate our production capacity deployment  in \\ndirect support of our mission.\\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\n56 – 67\\n\\n68 – 69\\n\\n70\\n\\n71\\n\\n72\\n\\n75\\n\\n1 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cDescription\\n\\nModel 3 is price competitively  with ICE equivalents. But, when compared on a total cost of ownership basis, the \\nModel 3 is much closer to a Toyota  Camry on all-in cost per mile than to an ICE equivalent such as a BMW  3 \\nSeries.\\n\\nOur data shows  that Tesla  vehicles are being driven more  than average vehicles  in the U.S., suggesting that they \\nare generally being used as a customer’s  primary vehicle. The superior range of our vehicles and a robust global \\nSupercharger Network  makes this possible.\\n\\nAt Tesla, safety  features  are not optional.  Our full suite of safety features  comes  standard with every  vehicle. \\nWhen we design vehicles,  first and foremost,  we want them to be safe. Our active safety  features  are powered  by \\neight cameras, a neural-net computer  and learnings from  our fleet  of over  two million  cars. \\n\\nIn 2021, we recorded  0.22 crashes for every  million  miles driven in which drivers  were using Autopilot  technology \\n(Autosteer  and active safety features).  For  drivers who were not using Autopilot  technology  (no Autosteer  and \\nactive safety  features), we recorded  0.77 crashes for every  million  miles driven. By comparison,  NHTSA’s  most \\nrecent data shows  that in the United States  there are 1.81 automobile  crashes for every  million  miles driven.\\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\n77 - 78\\n\\n79 - 80\\n\\n81 – 84\\n\\nTesla strived to go beyond industry standard testing. We leverage  data from our fleet  of over  two million cars to \\nbetter understand accidents and build solutions  around them. \\n\\n86 - 87\\n\\nFrom  2012  to 2021, there has been approximately  five Tesla  vehicle fires for every  billion  miles traveled.  By \\ncomparison,  data from the National  Fire Protection  Association  (NFPA)  and U.S. Department  of Transportation \\nshow that in the U.S. there are 53 vehicle  fires for every  billion miles  travelled.\\n\\nPairing energy storage with renewables is required to transition our grid to zero-emission  sources. In 2021,  in \\norder  to meet  demand that is well in excess  of supply for  energy storage  products, Tesla began building a new \\nproduction  facility capable of producing 40,000,000  kWh of energy  storage  per year.\\n\\n91- 92\\n\\nElectric grid disturbances in the U.S. have increased dramatically over the last 15 years. Our solar and storage \\nproducts not only deliver cost savings and energy independence, but they also harden the grid from adverse \\nevents in a cost-effective  and environmentally  friendly manner.\\n\\n85\\n\\n90\\n\\n93\\n\\nPassive Safety & Tesla Safety Awards\\n\\nSince 2019, Tesla  vehicles earned 5-star ratings from  safety rating agencies across the U.S., Europe and Australia. \\n\\n88 - 89\\n\\nSummary – Product Impact\\n\\nTopic\\n\\nProduct Affordability \\n(Price Equivalency & \\nTotal Cost  of Ownership)\\n\\nProduct Usage & Usability\\n\\nVehicle Safety\\n\\nAutopilot  Safety\\n\\nData Driven Safety\\n\\nFire Risk\\n\\nSolar + Storage  Products\\n\\nResilience of the Grid\\n\\n1 2 0\\n\\n\\x0cSummary – Supply Chain\\n\\nTopic\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nBattery Recycling\\n\\nAlignment with Best Practices\\n\\nBattery Supply Chain\\n\\nResponsible  Sourcing & \\nTesla Supplier Audit Program\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nProtecting  human rights and the environment  is core to our procurement  strategy.  Our responsible  sourcing \\nstrategy  aims to increase  the share of direct procurement  and continually  improve  local conditions  of the \\ncommunities  from  where we source.\\n\\nTesla is building capacity to recycle manufacturing scrap and end of life batteries  in order  to close the loop on \\nbattery raw materials. By the end of 2021, our battery  recycling facility at Gigafactory  Nevada  achieved a \\nproduction  rate of over 50 tons of recycled  material  per week.\\n\\nOur responsible  sourcing program  is based on the OECD Due Diligence  Guidance for  Responsible  Mineral  Supply \\nChains. This means Tesla collects  data from  its supply chain (including through audits), translates this data into \\non-the-ground  actions  and discloses  the outcomes  in our annual Impact Report.\\n\\nWe have prioritized  responsible  sourcing activities for cobalt, lithium and nickel given their unique significance to \\nEVs and energy storage. To ensure we are appropriately  managing risk, we continue to map our supply chain, \\nconduct in third-party audits and on-the-ground engagements, and collaborate  with industry initiatives to ensure \\nour suppliers are living up to our strict standards. \\n\\nIn 2018, Tesla initiated  its Supplier  Audit program  with the objective  to extend our supplier performance \\nevaluation  to key environmental,  social, and governance  metrics relevant  to Tesla’s business. As of the end of \\n2021,  we had a total  of 152 supplier  locations  go through our Suppler Audit at least once, representing  144 \\nsuppliers, or 10%  of 2021 spend with our direct supply base. \\n\\nPage(s)\\n\\n96 - 97\\n\\n95\\n\\n98\\n\\n99 - 111\\n\\n112 - 115\\n\\n1 2 1\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix\\nKey Metrics\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(solar charged)\\n\\nModel 3 Ridesharing Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nModel 3 Personal Use\\n(grid charged)\\n\\nAvg.

To start, we identified  over  40 issues in key areas that could \\ndirectly or indirectly impact our business. The topics ranged from economic,  environmental,  social and \\ngovernance  issues. These issues were identified  from  four components: (1) a competitive  landscape review,  (2) \\ninterviews  with investors  and other  key external  stakeholders,  (3) industry reports and documented  research, \\nsuch as the World  Economic Forum’s  2021  Global  Risks Report  and (4) external ESG frameworks  relevant  to our \\nindustry and regulatory requirements  across global capital markets.\\n\\nTesla’s  Sustainability  Council  refined the list of 40 key  issues into a survey  containing 25 questions  in an effort \\nto help us prioritize  these topics for operational  management  and disclosure in this year’s Impact Report. As \\npart of  the assessment,  we surveyed  our key  stakeholders,  asking them to rate the identified  economic and ESG \\ntopics on a scale of 1-5, based on their perceived importance  and impact to Tesla’s  business. A total of 2,168 \\nindividuals from Tesla  and approximately  40 external partners,  including trade associations,  universities, \\nsuppliers, environmental  consultants, nonprofits  and local administrators,  responded  to the survey.  35% of \\nresponses  came from North America,  57%  from China and 8% from Europe.

For those that disclose their methodology we have found that vehicle life is often estimated to be as low \\nas 10 years and annual distance traveled by vehicles as low as 6,200 miles. This compares to an average life of 17 \\nyears in the U.S. (20 years in Europe) and 12,000 annual miles in the U.S. (and 7,450 in Europe). When taken \\ntogether, even before considering the impacts of using real-world MPG instead of NEDC, WLTP or EPA ratings, this \\nleads to a drastic under-reporting of Scope 3 emissions.\\n\\nTo estimate CO2e savings, we first measured the amount of miles driven by our vehicles and kWh of electricity \\ngenerated and stored by our solar panels and energy storage products at the state, province, and country level for \\n2021. We then applied an emissions savings factor (in gCO2e/mi for miles driven and gCO2e/kWh for electricity \\ngenerated), for each state, province, and country to estimate CO2e avoided. For miles driven, the emissions savings \\nfactor is the net of estimated emissions from our vehicles and an ICE with a real-world fuel efficiency rating of ~24 \\nmpg. The emissions savings factor is based on grid emissions intensity in each respective location and includes \\nupstream emissions from the production and transport of fuels. \\n\\nFigures based on actual electricity consumption from utility bills for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 2020 and 2021 \\nfigures also include measured consumption for on-site fuel use including propane, diesel and gasoline. Figures for \\n2012-2017 for electricity, and 2012-2019 for on-site fuel use, are estimated based on actuals scaled for vehicle and \\nbattery production for each respective year and facility. \\n\\nFor simplicity, select categories were combined based on similarity of emissions source. Emissions from Agriculture \\nwere combined with emissions from Land-Use Change and Forestry under the label “Agriculture, Land-Use Change \\nand Forestry.” Emissions from Industrial Processes were combined with emissions from \\nManufacturing/Construction under the label “Industry.” Emissions from Waste, Fugitive Emissions, Other Fuel \\nCombustion and Bunker Fuels (U.S.-only) were combined under the label “Other Energy.”\\n\\nFigures for peer benchmarking were sourced from the latest available EEO-1 disclosure on each company’s website. \\nFor comparability, all figures were converted to percentages of total workforce. Figures for each Tech and \\nAutomotive industry were calculated based on an average of the percentages for the companies in each respective \\nindustry. Tables on pages 37 and 38 represent the difference in representation in Tesla’s workforce across each \\ncategory. \\n\\nCompanies in the Tech average: Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Cisco, Meta, HPE, Lyft, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia, \\nOracle, Qualcomm, Salesforce, and Uber\\nCompanies in the Automotive average: Ford and General Motors \\n\\n1 3 4\\n\\n\\x0cAppendix\\n\\nMetric / Disclosure / Topic\\n\\nSource(s)\\n\\nMethodology / Definition\\n\\nScope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Definition\\n\\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol\\n\\n6,500 miles\\nAt the moment, the manufacturing process of a Model 3 results in slightly higher \\nGHG emissions than an equivalent combustion engine vehicle.

This reference \\nvalue is based on a currently produced mid-size premium sedan that is comparable to the Model 3. The accuracy of \\nthis estimate for the other ICE vehicles directly depends on how their material compositions compared to that of \\nthe reference vehicle as well as on the existing variability of environmental impact profiles across different \\ngeographies and suppliers.\\n\\nAs such, the specific carbon footprint (GWP100/kg) of the reference vehicle is only a proxy for the average \\npremium mid-size ICE vehicle. Based on past work on automotive LCAs (Rohde-Brandenburger & Koffler, 2019) \\n(Koffler C. 873 , 2013) (Koffler C. , 2010) (Koffler C. , Krinke, Schebek, & Buchgeister, 2008) (Koffler C. , 2007), the \\nuncertainty of these estimates is estimated to be less than ±20% for a cradle-to-gate system boundary, and \\ntherefore less than ±5% once the use-phase is added.\\n\\nThe reference manufacturer’s Environmental Certificates are calculated using the same BOM import functionality of \\nthe GaBi DfX software used for the Model 3 in the LCA authored by Sphera as well as GaBi 878 databases for all \\nbackground data.\\n\\nBenchmark mid-size premium ICE vehicles include BMW 330i 2.0, Audi A4 2.0, Mercedes-Benz C300 2.0, Alfa \\nRomeo Giulia 2.0, Volvo S60 2.0, Cadillac ATS 2.0, Lexus IS 300 2.0 and Infiniti Q50 2.0.\\nBenchmark cross-over SUV premium ICE vehicles include BMW X3, Audi Q5, Mercedes GLC, Jaguar F-Pace, AR \\nStelvio, Volvo XC60, Cadillac XT5, Lexus NX and Porsche Macan.\\n\\nFigured based on owner-reported fuel economy from Consumer Reports for the latest available model year (2018-\\n2020, depending on the make/model). 24.8 MPG is representative of the average of Alfa Romeo Giulia , Audi A4, \\nBMW 330i, Cadillac ATS, Infiniti Q50, Lexus IS 300, Mercedes-Benz C300, and Volvo S60. use-phase GWP100 of \\n~400 gCO2e/mi includes gasoline production and distribution emissions from GaBi 2019 databases as well as \\nconsideration of bio-fuel mix of gasoline in the U.S. (~12%).\\n\\nFigure inclusive of: raw and semi-finished material production including transportation, mechanical processing and \\nshaping, battery manufacturing, vehicle assembly and paint shop, all fuels and energy (natural gas, electricity,  etc.), \\nother auxiliaries (lubricants, water, etc.) and end-of-life disposal.\\n\\nFigure exclusive of: capital goods (e.g., machinery, buildings), infrastructure (e.g., roads, power transmission \\nsystems), employee commute, external charging equipment and infrastructure, maintenance and service during use, \\npackaging, transport to recycler, disposal of manufacturing waste, inbound transportation from Tier 1 suppliers, \\ndistribution to customers. Excluded activities are estimated to represent minor contributions to the cradle-to-gate \\nas well as the overall LCA results.\\n\\nWhere solar and storage are assumed to be a fuel source for the use-phase of the Model 3Y, emissions were \\nincluded in the manufacturing phase figure. The Model 3Y Rideshare Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 100% \\nof these emissions on a per mile basis, while the Model 3Y Personal Use (solar charged) scenario is allocated 82% of \\nthese emissions and 18% grid-charged emissions on a per mile basis (based on observed supercharging vs. other \\nsplit).\\n\\nUse-phase emissions for grid charging are based on Model 3 and Model Y delivery-weighted state, province and \\ncountry level grid mix based on grid carbon intensity data. \\nU.S. Source: U.S. Department of Energy | E.U. + EFTA Source: IEA | China Source: China Electricity Council's China \\nPower Industry Annual Report 2021\\nUse-phase emissions calculated using the geographic distribution of the Model 3 and Model Y in each respective \\nregion based on Tesla's delivery data, which weights state, province and country level carbon intensity figures and \\nassumes no change in grid mix into the future.
